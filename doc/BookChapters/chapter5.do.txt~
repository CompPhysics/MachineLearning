======= Support Vector Machines, overarching aims  =======

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful and versatile
Machine Learning method, capable of performing linear or nonlinear
classification, regression, and even outlier detection. It is one of
the most popular models in Machine Learning, and anyone interested in
Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are
particularly well suited for classification of complex but small-sized or
medium-sized datasets.  

The case with two well-separated classes only can be understood in an
intuitive way in terms of lines in a two-dimensional space separating
the two classes (see figure below).

The basic mathematics behind the SVM is however less familiar to most of us. 
It relies on the definition of hyperplanes and the
definition of a _margin_ which separates classes (in case of
classification problems) of variables. It is also used for regression
problems.

With SVMs we distinguish between hard margin and soft margins. The
latter introduces a so-called softening parameter to be discussed
below.  We distinguish also between linear and non-linear
approaches. The latter are the most frequent ones since it is rather
unlikely that we can separate classes easily by say straight lines.


===== Hyperplanes and all that =====

The theory behind support vector machines (SVM hereafter) is based on
the mathematical description of so-called hyperplanes. Let us start
with a two-dimensional case. This will also allow us to introduce our
first SVM examples. These will be tailored to the case of two specific
classes, as displayed in the figure here based on the usage of the petal data.

We assume here that our data set can be well separated into two
domains, where a straight line does the job in the separating the two
classes. Here the two classes are represented by either squares or
circles.

The aim of the SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in a
$p$-dimensional space, where $p$ is the number of features that
distinctly classifies the data points.

In a $p$-dimensional space, a hyperplane is what we call an affine subspace of dimension of $p-1$.
As an example, in two dimension, a hyperplane is simply as straight line while in three dimensions it is 
a two-dimensional subspace, or stated simply, a plane. 

In two dimensions, with the variables $x_1$ and $x_2$, the hyperplane is defined as
!bt
\[
b+w_1x_1+w_2x_2=0,
\]
!et

where $b$ is the intercept and $w_1$ and $w_2$ define the elements of a vector orthogonal to the line 
$b+w_1x_1+w_2x_2=0$. 
In two dimensions we define the vectors $\bm{x} =[x1,x2]$ and $\bm{w}=[w1,w2]$. 
We can then rewrite the above equation as 

!bt
\[
\bm{x}^T\bm{w}+b=0.
\]
!et


We limit ourselves to two classes of outputs $y_i$ and assign these classes the values $y_i = \pm 1$. 
In a $p$-dimensional space of say $p$ features we have a hyperplane defines as 
!bt
\[
b+wx_1+w_2x_2+\dots +w_px_p=0.
\]
!et
If we define a 
matrix $\bm{X}=\left[\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_2,\dots, \bm{x}_p\right]$
of dimension $n\times p$, where $n$ represents the observations for each feature and each vector $x_i$ is a column vector of the matrix $\bm{X}$, 
!bt
\[
\bm{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_{i1} \\ x_{i2} \\ \dots \\ \dots \\ x_{ip} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
If the above condition is not met for a given vector $\bm{x}_i$ we have 
!bt
\[
b+w_1x_{i1}+w_2x_{i2}+\dots +w_px_{ip} >0,
\]
!et
if our output $y_i=1$.
In this case we say that $\bm{x}_i$ lies on one of the sides of the hyperplane and if 
!bt
\[
b+w_1x_{i1}+w_2x_{i2}+\dots +w_px_{ip} < 0,
\]
!et
for the class of observations $y_i=-1$, 
then $\bm{x}_i$ lies on the other side. 

Equivalently, for the two classes of observations we have 
!bt
\[
y_i\left(b+w_1x_{i1}+w_2x_{i2}+\dots +w_px_{ip}\right) > 0. 
\]
!et

When we try to separate hyperplanes, if it exists, we can use it to construct a natural classifier: a test observation is assigned a given class depending on which side of the hyperplane it is located.


=== The two-dimensional case ===

Let us try to develop our intuition about SVMs by limiting ourselves to a two-dimensional
plane.  To separate the two classes of data points, there are many
possible lines (hyperplanes if you prefer a more strict naming)  
that could be chosen. Our objective is to find a
plane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between
data points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance provides
some reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with
more confidence.

What a linear classifier attempts to accomplish is to split the
feature space into two half spaces by placing a hyperplane between the
data points.  This hyperplane will be our decision boundary.  All
points on one side of the plane will belong to class one and all points
on the other side of the plane will belong to the second class two.

Unfortunately there are many ways in which we can place a hyperplane
to divide the data.  Below is an example of two candidate hyperplanes
for our data sample.


Let us define the function
!bt
\[
f(x) = \bm{w}^T\bm{x}+b = 0,
\]
!et
as the function that determines the line $L$ that separates two classes (our two features), see the figure here. 


Any point defined by $\bm{x}_i$ and $\bm{x}_2$ on the line $L$ will satisfy $\bm{w}^T(\bm{x}_1-\bm{x}_2)=0$. 

The signed distance $\delta$ from any point defined by a vector $\bm{x}$ and a point $\bm{x}_0$ on the line $L$ is then
!bt
\[
\delta = \frac{1}{\vert\vert \bm{w}\vert\vert}(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}+b).
\]
!et



How do we find the parameter $b$ and the vector $\bm{w}$? What we could
do is to define a cost function which now contains the set of all
misclassified points $M$ and attempt to minimize this function

!bt
\[
C(\bm{w},b) = -\sum_{i\in M} y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b).
\]
!et

We could now for example define all values $y_i =1$ as misclassified in case we have $\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b < 0$ and the opposite if we have $y_i=-1$. Taking the derivatives gives us
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial b} = -\sum_{i\in M} y_i,
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \bm{w}} = -\sum_{i\in M} y_ix_i.
\]
!et



We can now use the Newton-Raphson method or different variants of the gradient descent family (from plain gradient descent to various stochastic gradient descent approaches) to solve the equations
!bt
\[
b \leftarrow b +\eta \frac{\partial C}{\partial b},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{w} \leftarrow \bm{w} +\eta \frac{\partial C}{\partial \bm{w}},
\]
!et
where $\eta$ is our by now well-known learning rate. 



The equations we discussed above can be coded rather easily (the
framework is similar to what we developed for logistic
regression). We are going to set up a simple case with two classes only and we want to find a line which separates them the best possible way.
!bc pycod

!ec


There are however problems with this approach, although it looks
pretty straightforward to implement. When running the above code, we see that we can easily end up with many diffeent lines which separate the two classes.


For small
gaps between the entries, we may also end up needing many iterations
before the solutions converge and if the data cannot be separated
properly into two distinct classes, we may not experience a converge
at all.


=== A better approach ===

A better approach is rather to try to define a large margin between
the two classes (if they are well separated from the beginning).

Thus, we wish to find a margin $M$ with $\bm{w}$ normalized to
$\vert\vert \bm{w}\vert\vert =1$ subject to the condition

!bt
\[
y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b) \geq M \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i=1,2,\dots, p. 
\]
!et
All points are thus at a signed distance from the decision boundary defined by the line $L$. The parameters $b$ and $w_1$ and $w_2$ define this line. 

We seek thus the largest value $M$ defined by
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{\vert \vert \bm{w}\vert\vert}y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b) \geq M \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i=1,2,\dots, n, 
\]
!et
or just 
!bt
\[
y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b) \geq M\vert \vert \bm{w}\vert\vert \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i. 
\]
!et
If we scale the equation so that $\vert \vert \bm{w}\vert\vert = 1/M$, we have to find the minimum of 
$\bm{w}^T\bm{w}=\vert \vert \bm{w}\vert\vert$ (the norm) subject to the condition
!bt
\[
y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b) \geq 1 \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i.
\]
!et

We have thus defined our margin as the invers of the norm of
$\bm{w}$. We want to minimize the norm in order to have a as large as
possible margin $M$. Before we proceed, we need to remind ourselves
about Lagrangian multipliers.


===== A quick Reminder on Lagrangian Multipliers =====

Consider a function of three independent variables $f(x,y,z)$ . For the function $f$ to be an
extreme we have
!bt
\[
df=0.
\]
!et
A necessary and sufficient condition is
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}=0,
\]
!et
due to
!bt
\[
df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz.
\]
!et
In many problems the variables $x,y,z$ are often subject to constraints (such as those above for the margin)
so that they are no longer all independent. It is possible at least in principle to use each 
constraint to eliminate one variable
and to proceed with a new and smaller set of independent varables.

The use of so-called Lagrangian  multipliers is an alternative technique  when the elimination
of variables is incovenient or undesirable.  Assume that we have an equation of constraint on 
the variables $x,y,z$
!bt
\[
\phi(x,y,z) = 0,
\]
!et
 resulting in
!bt
\[
d\phi = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}dz =0.
\]
!et
Now we cannot set anymore
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}=0,
\]
!et
if $df=0$ is wanted
because there are now only two independent variables!  Assume $x$ and $y$ are the independent 
variables.
Then $dz$ is no longer arbitrary.


However, we can add to
!bt
\[
df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz,
\]
!et
a multiplum of $d\phi$, viz. $\lambda d\phi$, resulting  in
!bt
\[
df+\lambda d\phi = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}+\lambda
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x})dx+(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}+\lambda\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y})dy+
(\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}+\lambda\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z})dz =0.
\]
!et
Our multiplier is chosen so that
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}+\lambda\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} =0.
\]
!et

We need to remember that we took $dx$ and $dy$ to be arbitrary and thus we must have
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+\lambda\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} =0,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}+\lambda\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} =0.
\]
!et
When all these equations are satisfied, $df=0$.  We have four unknowns, $x,y,z$ and
$\lambda$. Actually we want only $x,y,z$, $\lambda$ needs not to be determined, 
it is therefore often called
Lagrange's undetermined multiplier.
If we have a set of constraints $\phi_k$ we have the equations
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}+\sum_k\lambda_k\frac{\partial \phi_k}{\partial x_i} =0.
\]
!et


In order to solve the above problem, we define the following Lagrangian function to be minimized 
!bt
\[
{\cal L}(\lambda,b,\bm{w})=\frac{1}{2}\bm{w}^T\bm{w}-\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i\left[y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b)-1\right],
\]
!et
where $\lambda_i$ is a so-called Lagrange multiplier subject to the condition $\lambda_i \geq 0$.

Taking the derivatives  with respect to $b$ and $\bm{w}$ we obtain 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial {\cal L}}{\partial b} = -\sum_{i} \lambda_iy_i=0,
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial {\cal L}}{\partial \bm{w}} = 0 = \bm{w}-\sum_{i} \lambda_iy_i\bm{x}_i.
\]
!et
Inserting these constraints into the equation for ${\cal L}$ we obtain
!bt
\[
{\cal L}=\sum_i\lambda_i-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}^n\lambda_i\lambda_jy_iy_j\bm{x}_i^T\bm{x}_j,
\]
!et
subject to the constraints $\lambda_i\geq 0$ and $\sum_i\lambda_iy_i=0$. 
We must in addition satisfy the "Karush-Kuhn-Tucker":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions" (KKT) condition
!bt
\[
\lambda_i\left[y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b) -1\right] \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i.
\]
!et
o If $\lambda_i > 0$, then $y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b)=1$ and we say that $x_i$ is on the boundary.
o If $y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b)> 1$, we say $x_i$ is not on the boundary and we set $\lambda_i=0$. 
When $\lambda_i > 0$, the vectors $\bm{x}_i$ are called support vectors. They are the vectors closest to the line (or hyperplane) and define the margin $M$. 


We can rewrite 
!bt
\[
{\cal L}=\sum_i\lambda_i-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}^n\lambda_i\lambda_jy_iy_j\bm{x}_i^T\bm{x}_j,
\]
!et
and its constraints in terms of a matrix-vector problem where we minimize w.r.t. $\lambda$ the following problem
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{2} \bm{\lambda}^T\begin{bmatrix} y_1y_1\bm{x}_1^T\bm{x}_1 & y_1y_2\bm{x}_1^T\bm{x}_2 & \dots & \dots & y_1y_n\bm{x}_1^T\bm{x}_n \\
y_2y_1\bm{x}_2^T\bm{x}_1 & y_2y_2\bm{x}_2^T\bm{x}_2 & \dots & \dots & y_1y_n\bm{x}_2^T\bm{x}_n \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
y_ny_1\bm{x}_n^T\bm{x}_1 & y_ny_2\bm{x}_n^T\bm{x}_2 & \dots & \dots & y_ny_n\bm{x}_n^T\bm{x}_n \\
\end{bmatrix}\bm{\lambda}-\mathbb{1}\bm{\lambda}, 
\]
!et
subject to $\bm{y}^T\bm{\lambda}=0$. Here we defined the vectors $\bm{\lambda} =[\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_n]$ and 
$\bm{y}=[y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n]$. 



Solving the above problem, yields the values of $\lambda_i$.
To find the coefficients of your hyperplane we need simply to compute 
!bt
\[
\bm{w}=\sum_{i} \lambda_iy_i\bm{x}_i.
\]
!et
With our vector $\bm{w}$ we can in turn find the value of the intercept $b$ (here in two dimensions) via 
!bt
\[
y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b)=1,
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\[
b = \frac{1}{y_i}-\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i,
\]
!et
or if we write it out in terms of the support vectors only, with $N_s$ being their number,  we have
!bt
\[
b = \frac{1}{N_s}\sum_{j\in N_s}\left(y_j-\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_iy_i\bm{x}_i^T\bm{x}_j\right).
\]
!et
With our hyperplane coefficients we can use our classifier to assign any observation by simply using 
!bt
\[
y_i = \mathrm{sign}(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b).
\]
!et
Below we discuss how to find the optimal values of $\lambda_i$. Before we proceed however, we discuss now the so-called soft classifier. 


===== A soft classifier =====

Till now, the margin is strictly defined by the support vectors. This defines what is called a hard classifier, that is the margins are well defined.

Suppose now that classes overlap in feature space, as shown in the
figure here. One way to deal with this problem before we define the
so-called _kernel approach_, is to allow a kind of slack in the sense
that we allow some points to be on the wrong side of the margin.

We introduce thus the so-called _slack_ variables $\bm{\xi} =[\xi_1,x_2,\dots,x_n]$ and 
modify our previous equation
!bt
\[
y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b)=1,
\]
!et
to 
!bt
\[
y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b)=1-\xi_i,
\]
!et
with the requirement $\xi_i\geq 0$. The total violation is now $\sum_i\xi$. 
The value $\xi_i$ in the constraint the last constraint corresponds to the  amount by which the prediction
$y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b)=1$ is on the wrong side of its margin. Hence by bounding the sum $\sum_i \xi_i$,
we bound the total amount by which predictions fall on the wrong side of their margins.

Misclassifications occur when $\xi_i > 1$. Thus bounding the total sum by some value $C$ bounds in turn the total number of
misclassifications.


This has in turn the consequences that we change our optmization problem to finding the minimum of 
!bt
\[
{\cal L}=\frac{1}{2}\bm{w}^T\bm{w}-\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i\left[y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b)-(1-\xi_)\right]+C\sum_{i=1}^n\xi_i-\sum_{i=1}^n\gamma_i\xi_i,
\]
!et
subject to 
!bt
\[
y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b)=1-\xi_i \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i,
\]
!et
with the requirement $\xi_i\geq 0$.

Taking the derivatives  with respect to $b$ and $\bm{w}$ we obtain 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial {\cal L}}{\partial b} = -\sum_{i} \lambda_iy_i=0,
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial {\cal L}}{\partial \bm{w}} = 0 = \bm{w}-\sum_{i} \lambda_iy_i\bm{x}_i, 
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\lambda_i = C-\gamma_i \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i.
\]
!et
Inserting these constraints into the equation for ${\cal L}$ we obtain the same equation as before
!bt
\[
{\cal L}=\sum_i\lambda_i-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}^n\lambda_i\lambda_jy_iy_j\bm{x}_i^T\bm{x}_j,
\]
!et
but now subject to the constraints $\lambda_i\geq 0$, $\sum_i\lambda_iy_i=0$ and $0\leq\lambda_i \leq C$. 
We must in addition satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition which now reads
!bt
\[
\lambda_i\left[y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b) -(1-\xi_)\right]=0 \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\gamma_i\xi_i = 0,
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{x}_i+b) -(1-\xi_) \geq 0 \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i.
\]
!et


===== Kernels and non-linearity =====

The cases we have studied till now, were all characterized by two classes
with a close to linear separability. The classifiers we have described
so far find linear boundaries in our input feature space. It is
possible to make our procedure more flexible by exploring the feature
space using other basis expansions such as higher-order polynomials,
wavelets, splines etc.

If our feature space is not easy to separate, as shown in the figure
here, we can achieve a better separation by introducing more complex
basis functions. The ideal would be, as shown in the next figure, to, via a specific transformation to 
obtain a separation between the classes which is almost linear. 

The change of basis, from $x\rightarrow z=\phi(x)$ leads to the same type of equations to be solved, except that
we need to introduce for example a polynomial transformation to a two-dimensional training set.

With our new basis, the equations we solved earlier are basically the same, that is we have now (without the slack option for simplicity)
!bt
\[
{\cal L}=\sum_i\lambda_i-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}^n\lambda_i\lambda_jy_iy_j\bm{z}_i^T\bm{z}_j,
\]
!et
subject to the constraints $\lambda_i\geq 0$, $\sum_i\lambda_iy_i=0$, and for the support vectors
!bt
\[
y_i(\bm{w}^T\bm{z}_i+b)= 1 \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i,
\]
!et
from which we also find $b$.
To compute $\bm{z}_i^T\bm{z}_j$ we define the kernel $K(\bm{x}_i,\bm{x}_j)$ as
!bt
\[
K(\bm{x}_i,\bm{x}_j)=\bm{z}_i^T\bm{z}_j= \phi(\bm{x}_i)^T\phi(\bm{x}_j).
\]
!et
For the above example, the kernel reads
!bt
\[
K(\bm{x}_i,\bm{x}_j)=[x_i^2, y_i^2, \sqrt{2}x_iy_i]^T\begin{bmatrix} x_j^2 \\ y_j^2 \\ \sqrt{2}x_jy_j \end{bmatrix}=x_i^2x_j^2+2x_ix_jy_iy_j+y_i^2y_j^2.
\]
!et

We note that this is nothing but the dot product of the two original
vectors $(\bm{x}_i^T\bm{x}_j)^2$. Instead of thus computing the
product in the Lagrangian of $\bm{z}_i^T\bm{z}_j$ we simply compute
the dot product $(\bm{x}_i^T\bm{x}_j)^2$.


This leads to the so-called
kernel trick and the result leads to the same as if we went through
the trouble of performing the transformation
$\phi(\bm{x}_i)^T\phi(\bm{x}_j)$ during the SVM calculations.



Using our definition of the kernel We can rewrite again the Lagrangian
!bt
\[
{\cal L}=\sum_i\lambda_i-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}^n\lambda_i\lambda_jy_iy_j\bm{x}_i^T\bm{z}_j,
\]
!et
subject to the constraints $\lambda_i\geq 0$, $\sum_i\lambda_iy_i=0$ in terms of a convex optimization problem
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{2} \bm{\lambda}^T\begin{bmatrix} y_1y_1K(\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_1) & y_1y_2K(\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_2) & \dots & \dots & y_1y_nK(\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_n) \\
y_2y_1K(\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_1) & y_2y_2(\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_2) & \dots & \dots & y_1y_nK(\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_n) \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
y_ny_1K(\bm{x}_n,\bm{x}_1) & y_ny_2K(\bm{x}_n\bm{x}_2) & \dots & \dots & y_ny_nK(\bm{x}_n,\bm{x}_n) \\
\end{bmatrix}\bm{\lambda}-\mathbb{1}\bm{\lambda}, 
\]
!et
subject to $\bm{y}^T\bm{\lambda}=0$. Here we defined the vectors $\bm{\lambda} =[\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_n]$ and 
$\bm{y}=[y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n]$. 
If we add the slack constants this leads to the additional constraint $0\leq \lambda_i \leq C$.

We can rewrite this (see the solutions below) in terms of a convex optimization problem of the type
!bt
\begin{align*}
    &\mathrm{min}_{\lambda}\hspace{0.2cm} \frac{1}{2}\bm{\lambda}^T\bm{P}\bm{\lambda}+\bm{q}^T\bm{\lambda},\\ \nonumber
    &\mathrm{subject\hspace{0.1cm}to} \hspace{0.2cm} \bm{G}\bm{\lambda} \preceq \bm{h} \hspace{0.2cm} \wedge \bm{A}\bm{\lambda}=f.
\end{align*}
!et
Below we discuss how to solve these equations. Here we note that the matrix $\bm{P}$ has matrix elements $p_{ij}=y_iy_jK(\bm{x}_i,\bm{x}_j)$.
Given a kernel $K$ and the targets $y_i$ this matrix is easy to set up. The constraint $\bm{y}^T\bm{\lambda}=0$ leads to $f=0$ and $\bm{A}=\bm{y}$. How to set up the matrix $\bm{G}$ is discussed later. Here note that the inequalities $0\leq \lambda_i \leq C$ can be split up into
$0\leq \lambda_i$ and $\lambda_i \leq C$. These two inequalities define then the matrix $\bm{G}$ and the vector $\bm{h}$.



===== Different kernels and Mercer's theorem =====

There are several popular kernels being used. These are
o Linear: $K(\bm{x},\bm{y})=\bm{x}^T\bm{y}$,
o Polynomial: $K(\bm{x},\bm{y})=(\bm{x}^T\bm{y}+\gamma)^d$,
o Gaussian Radial Basis Function: $K(\bm{x},\bm{y})=\exp{\left(-\gamma\vert\vert\bm{x}-\bm{y}\vert\vert^2\right)}$,
o Tanh: $K(\bm{x},\bm{y})=\tanh{(\bm{x}^T\bm{y}+\gamma)}$,
and many other ones.

An important theorem for us is "Mercer's
theorem":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer%27s_theorem".  The
theorem states that if a kernel function $K$ is symmetric, continuous
and leads to a positive semi-definite matrix $\bm{P}$ then there
exists a function $\phi$ that maps $\bm{x}_i$ and $\bm{x}_j$ into
another space (possibly with much higher dimensions) such that

!bt
\[
K(\bm{x}_i,\bm{x}_j)=\phi(\bm{x}_i)^T\phi(\bm{x}_j).
\]
!et

So you can use $K$ as a kernel since you know $\phi$ exists, even if
you don’t know what $\phi$ is. 

Note that some frequently used kernels (such as the Sigmoid kernel)
don’t respect all of Mercer’s conditions, yet they generally work well
in practice.

=====  Mathematical optimization of convex functions =====

A mathematical (quadratic) optimization problem, or just optimization problem, has the form
!bt
\begin{align*}
    &\mathrm{min}_{\lambda}\hspace{0.2cm} \frac{1}{2}\bm{\lambda}^T\bm{P}\bm{\lambda}+\bm{q}^T\bm{\lambda},\\ \nonumber
    &\mathrm{subject\hspace{0.1cm}to} \hspace{0.2cm} \bm{G}\bm{\lambda} \preceq \bm{h} \wedge  \bm{A}\bm{\lambda}=f.
\end{align*}
!et
subject to some constraints for say a selected set $i=1,2,\dots, n$.
In our case we are optimizing with respect to the Lagrangian multipliers $\lambda_i$, and the
vector $\bm{\lambda}=[\lambda_1, \lambda_2,\dots, \lambda_n]$ is the optimization variable we are dealing with.

In our case we are particularly interested in a class of optimization problems called convex optmization problems. 
In our discussion on gradient descent methods we discussed at length the definition of a convex function. 

Convex optimization problems play a central role in applied mathematics and we recommend strongly "Boyd and Vandenberghe's text on the topics":"http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/".




If we use Python as programming language and wish to venture beyond
_scikit-learn_, _tensorflow_ and similar software which makes our
lives so much easier, we need to dive into the wonderful world of
quadratic programming. We can, if we wish, solve the minimization
problem using say standard gradient methods or conjugate gradient
methods. However, these methods tend to exhibit a rather slow
converge. So, welcome to the promised land of quadratic programming.

The functions we need are contained in the quadratic programming package _CVXOPT_ and we need to import it together with _numpy_ as

!bc pycod
import numpy
import cvxopt
!ec

This will make our life much easier. You don't need t write your own optimizer.



We remind ourselves about the general problem we want to solve
!bt
\begin{align*}
    &\mathrm{min}_{x}\hspace{0.2cm} \frac{1}{2}\bm{x}^T\bm{P}\bm{x}+\bm{q}^T\bm{x},\\ \nonumber
    &\mathrm{subject\hspace{0.1cm} to} \hspace{0.2cm} \bm{G}\bm{x} \preceq \bm{h} \wedge  \bm{A}\bm{x}=f.
\end{align*}
!et

Let us show how to perform the optmization using a simple case. Assume we want to optimize the following problem
!bt
\begin{align*}
    &\mathrm{min}_{x}\hspace{0.2cm} \frac{1}{2}x^2+5x+3y \\ \nonumber
    &\mathrm{subject to} \\ \nonumber
    &x, y \geq 0 \\ \nonumber
    &x+3y  \geq 15 \\ \nonumber
    &2x+5y  \leq  100 \\ \nonumber
    &3x+4y  \leq  80.  \\ \nonumber
\end{align*}
!et
The minimization problem can be rewritten in terms of vectors and matrices as (with $x$ and $y$ being the unknowns)
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} x\\ y \end{bmatrix}^T   \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0  \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}  + \begin{bmatrix}3\\ 4  \end{bmatrix}^T \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y  \end{bmatrix}.  
\]
!et
Similarly, we can now set up the inequalities (we need to change $\geq$ to $\leq$ by multiplying with $-1$ on bot sides) as the following matrix-vector equation
!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \\ -1 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \\ 3 & 4\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y\end{bmatrix} \preceq \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0\\ -15 \\ 100 \\ 80\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
We have collapsed all the inequalities into a single matrix $\bm{G}$. We see also that our matrix 
!bt
\[
\bm{P} =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0  \end{bmatrix}
\]
!et
is clearly positive semi-definite (all eigenvalues larger or equal zero). 
Finally, the vector $\bm{h}$ is defined as 
!bt
\[
\bm{h} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0\\ -15 \\ 100 \\ 80\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et


Since we don't have any equalities the matrix $\bm{A}$ is set to zero
The following code solves the equations for us
!bc pycod
# Import the necessary packages
import numpy
from cvxopt import matrix
from cvxopt import solvers
P = matrix(numpy.diag([1,0]), tc=’d’)
q = matrix(numpy.array([3,4]), tc=’d’)
G = matrix(numpy.array([[-1,0],[0,-1],[-1,-3],[2,5],[3,4]]), tc=’d’)
h = matrix(numpy.array([0,0,-15,100,80]), tc=’d’)
# Construct the QP, invoke solver
sol = solvers.qp(P,q,G,h)
# Extract optimal value and solution
sol[’x’] 
sol[’primal objective’]
!ec


We are now ready to return to our setup of the optmization problem for a more realistic case. Introducing the _slack_ parameter $C$ we have
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{2} \bm{\lambda}^T\begin{bmatrix} y_1y_1K(\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_1) & y_1y_2K(\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_2) & \dots & \dots & y_1y_nK(\bm{x}_1,\bm{x}_n) \\
y_2y_1K(\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_1) & y_2y_2K(\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_2) & \dots & \dots & y_1y_nK(\bm{x}_2,\bm{x}_n) \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
y_ny_1K(\bm{x}_n,\bm{x}_1) & y_ny_2K(\bm{x}_n\bm{x}_2) & \dots & \dots & y_ny_nK(\bm{x}_n,\bm{x}_n) \\
\end{bmatrix}\bm{\lambda}-\mathbb{I}\bm{\lambda}, 
\]
!et
subject to $\bm{y}^T\bm{\lambda}=0$. Here we defined the vectors $\bm{\lambda} =[\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_n]$ and 
$\bm{y}=[y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n]$. 
With  the slack constants this leads to the additional constraint $0\leq \lambda_i \leq C$.

_code will be added_

    "The approach to the analysis of these new data sets should follow to a large extent what you did in projects 1 and 2. That is:\n",
    "1. Whether you end up with a regression or a classification problem, you should employ at least two of the methods we have discussed among **linear regression (including Ridge and Lasso)**, **Logistic Regression**, **Neural Networks**, **Convolution Neural Networks**, **Recurrent Neural Networks**, and **Autoencoders**. Recurrent neural networks and autoencoders are discussed during the last three weeks of lectures (November 10, 17 and 24).\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel also free to use support vector machines, $k$-means, decision trees, random forests, Gradient Boosting and principal components analysis, although the latter have not been covered during the lectures. This material can be found in the lecture notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For project 3, you should feel free to use your own codes from projects 1 and 2, or use the available functionality of **Scikit-Learn**, **Tensorflow**, PyTorch etc. \n",

    "2. The estimates you used and tested in projects 1 and 2 should also be included, that is the $R2$-score, **MSE**, confusion matrix, accuracy score, information gain,  ROC and Cumulative gains curves and other, cross-validation and/or bootstrap if these are relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Similarly, feel free to explore various activations functions in deep learning and various approachs to stochastic gradient descent approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If possible, you should link the data sets with exisiting research and analyses thereof. Scientific articles which have used Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the data are highly welcome. Perhaps you can improve previous analyses and even publish a new article? \n",
    "\n",
    "5. A critical assessment of the methods with ditto perspectives and recommendations is also something you need to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, the report should follow the same pattern as the two previous ones, with abstract, introduction, methods, code, results, conclusions etc.\n",

We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.\n",

    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network (ANN), is a computational model that\n",

    "\n",
    "It is supposed to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each\n",

    "mathematical functions between layers.  A wide variety of different\n",
    "ANNs have been developed, but most of them consist of an input layer,\n",
    "an output layer and eventual layers in-between, called *hidden\n",
    "layers*. All layers can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each\n",
    "connection between two nodes is associated with a weight variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks (also called neural nets) are neural-inspired\n",
    "nonlinear models for supervised learning.  As we will see, neural nets\n",
    "can be viewed as natural, more powerful extensions of supervised\n",
    "learning methods such as linear and logistic regression and soft-max\n",
    "methods we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was the first and simplest type\n",
    "of ANNs that were devised. In this network, the information moves in\n",
    "only one direction: forward through the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are represented by circles, while the arrows display the\n",
    "connections between the nodes, including the direction of information\n",
    "flow. Additionally, each arrow corresponds to a weight variable\n",
    "(figure to come).  We observe that each node in a layer is connected\n",
    "to *all* nodes in the subsequent layer, making this a so-called\n",
    "*fully-connected* FFNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "A different variant of FFNNs are *convolutional neural networks*\n",
    "(CNNs), which have a connectivity pattern inspired by the animal\n",
    "visual cortex. Individual neurons in the visual cortex only respond to\n",
    "stimuli from small sub-regions of the visual field, called a receptive\n",
    "field. This makes the neurons well-suited to exploit the strong\n",
    "spatially local correlation present in natural images. The response of\n",
    "each neuron can be approximated mathematically as a convolution\n",
    "operation.  (figure to come)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks emulate the behaviour of neurons in the\n",

    "nodes of adjacent layers: Each node in a convolutional layer is\n",
    "connected only to a subset of the nodes in the previous layer, in\n",
    "contrast to the fully-connected FFNN.  Often, CNNs consist of several\n",
    "convolutional layers that learn local features of the input, with a\n",
    "fully-connected layer at the end, which gathers all the local data and\n",
    "produces the outputs. They have wide applications in image and video\n",
    "recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only mentioned ANNs where information flows in one\n",
    "direction: forward. *Recurrent neural networks* on the other hand,\n",
    "have connections between nodes that form directed *cycles*. This\n",
    "creates a form of internal memory which are able to capture\n",
    "information on what has been calculated before; the output is\n",
    "dependent on the previous computations. Recurrent NNs make use of\n",
    "sequential information by performing the same task for every element\n",
    "in a sequence, where each element depends on previous elements. An\n",
    "example of such information is sentences, making recurrent NNs\n",
    "especially well-suited for handwriting and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other types of networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other kinds of ANNs that have been developed. One type\n",
    "that is specifically designed for interpolation in multidimensional\n",
    "space is the radial basis function (RBF) network. RBFs are typically\n",
    "made up of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with\n",
    "non-linear radial symmetric activation functions and a linear output\n",
    "layer (''linear'' here means that each node in the output layer has a\n",
    "linear activation function). The layers are normally fully-connected\n",
    "and there are no cycles, thus RBFs can be viewed as a type of\n",
    "fully-connected FFNN. They are however usually treated as a separate\n",
    "type of NN due the unusual activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "One uses often so-called fully-connected feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "with three or more layers (an input layer, one or more hidden layers\n",
    "and an output layer) consisting of neurons that have non-linear\n",
    "activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such networks are often called *multilayer perceptrons* (MLPs).\n",
    "\n",

    "According to the *Universal approximation theorem*, a feed-forward\n",

    "\n",

    "and $w_i$ is the weight to input $i$.  \n",
    "The activation of the neurons in the input layer is just the features (e.g. a pixel value).  \n",

    "This activation can be generalized to $k$ classes (using e.g. the *one-against-all* strategy), \n",

    "The denominator is a normalization factor to ensure the outputs (probabilities) sum up to 1.  \n",

    "Adding a bias value to the weighted sum of inputs allows the neural network to represent a greater range\n",
    "of values. Without it, any input with the value 0 will be mapped to zero (before being passed through the activation). The bias unit has an output of 1, and a weight to each neuron $j$, $b_j$:  \n",

    "## Choose cost function and optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure how well our neural network is doing we need to introduce a cost function.  \n",
    "We will call the function that gives the error of a single sample output the *loss* function, and the function\n",
    "that gives the total error of our network across all samples the *cost* function.\n",
    "A typical choice for multiclass classification is the *cross-entropy* loss, also known as the negative log likelihood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In *multiclass* classification it is common to treat each integer label as a so called *one-hot* vector:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = 5 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{y} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = 1 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{y} = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. a binary bit string of length $C$, where $C = 10$ is the number of classes in the MNIST dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y_{ic}$ denote the $c$-th component of the $i$-th one-hot vector.  \n",
    "We define the cost function $\\mathcal{C}$ as a sum over the cross-entropy loss for each point $\\hat{x}_i$ in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the one-hot representation only one of the terms in the loss function is non-zero, namely the\n",
    "probability of the correct category $c'$  \n",
    "(i.e. the category $c'$ such that $y_{ic'} = 1$). This means that the cross entropy loss only punishes you for how wrong\n",
    "you got the correct label. The probability of category $c$ is given by the softmax function. The vector $\\hat{\\theta}$ represents the parameters of our network, i.e. all the weights and biases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizing the cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is trained by finding the weights and biases that minimize the cost function. One of the most widely used classes of methods is *gradient descent* and its generalizations. The idea behind gradient descent\n",
    "is simply to adjust the weights in the direction where the gradient of the cost function is large and negative. This ensures we flow toward a *local* minimum of the cost function.  \n",
    "Each parameter $\\theta$ is iteratively adjusted according to the rule  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta_{i+1} = \\theta_i - \\eta \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta_i) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is known as the *learning rate*, which controls how big a step we take towards the minimum.  \n",
    "This update can be repeated for any number of iterations, or until we are satisfied with the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and effective improvement is a variant called *Batch Gradient Descent*.  \n",
    "Instead of calculating the gradient on the whole dataset, we calculate an approximation of the gradient\n",
    "on a subset of the data called a *minibatch*.  \n",
    "If there are $N$ data points and we have a minibatch size of $M$, the total number of batches\n",
    "is $N/M$.  \n",
    "We denote each minibatch $B_k$, with $k = 1, 2,...,N/M$. The gradient then becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n",
    "\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i \\in B_k} \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. instead of averaging the loss over the entire dataset, we average over a minibatch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This has two important benefits:  \n",
    "1. Introducing stochasticity decreases the chance that the algorithm becomes stuck in a local minima.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It significantly speeds up the calculation, since we do not have to use the entire dataset to calculate the gradient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The various optmization  methods, with codes and algorithms,  are discussed in our lectures on [Gradient descent approaches](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/Splines/html/Splines-bs.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to add an extra term to the cost function, proportional\n",
    "to the size of the weights.  This is equivalent to constraining the\n",
    "size of the weights, so that they do not grow out of control.\n",
    "Constraining the size of the weights means that the weights cannot\n",
    "grow arbitrarily large to fit the training data, and in this way\n",
    "reduces *overfitting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure the size of the weights using the so called *L2-norm*, meaning our cost function becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\mathcal{C}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n",
    "\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) + \\lambda \\lvert \\lvert \\hat{w} \\rvert \\rvert_2^2 \n",
    "= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) + \\lambda \\sum_{ij} w_{ij}^2,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. we sum up all the weights squared. The factor $\\lambda$ is known as a regularization parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the model, we need to calculate the derivative of\n",
    "the cost function with respect to every bias and weight in the\n",
    "network.  In total our network has $(64 + 1)\\times 50=3250$ weights in\n",
    "the hidden layer and $(50 + 1)\\times 10=510$ weights to the output\n",
    "layer ($+1$ for the bias), and the gradient must be calculated for\n",
    "every parameter.  We use the *backpropagation* algorithm discussed\n",
    "above. This is a clever use of the chain rule that allows us to\n",
    "calculate the gradient efficently. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix  multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "To more efficently train our network these equations are implemented using matrix operations.  \n",
    "The error in the output layer is calculated simply as, with $\\hat{t}$ being our targets,  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta_L = \\hat{t} - \\hat{y} = (n_{inputs}, n_{categories}) .$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient for the output weights is calculated as  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla W_{L} = \\hat{a}^T \\delta_L   = (n_{hidden}, n_{categories}) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{a} = (n_{inputs}, n_{hidden})$. This simply means that we are summing up the gradients for each input.  \n",
    "Since we are going backwards we have to transpose the activation matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient with respect to the output bias is then  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla \\hat{b}_{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{inputs}} \\delta_L = (n_{categories}) .$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The error in the hidden layer is  \n",

    "network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer until the\n",
    "activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made\n",
    "worse by the fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0\n",

    "the reverse direction when backpropagating gradients. We don’t want\n",
    "the signal to die out, nor do we want it to explode and saturate. For\n",
    "the signal to flow properly, the authors argue that we need the\n",

    "Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need labeled data**. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems."

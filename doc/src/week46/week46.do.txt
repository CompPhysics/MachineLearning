!split
===== From NNs and CNNs to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) =====

There are limitation of NNs, one of which being that FFNNs are not
designed to handle sequential data (data for which the order matters)
effectively because they lack the capabilities of storing information
about previous inputs; each input is being treated indepen-
dently. This is a limitation when dealing with sequential data where
past information can be vital to correctly process current and future
inputs. 


!split
===== What is a recurrent NN? =====

A recurrent neural network (RNN), as opposed to a regular fully
connected neural network (FCNN) or just neural network (NN), has
layers that are connected to themselves.
    

In an FCNN there are no connections between nodes in a single
layer. For instance, $(h_1^1$ is not connected to $(h_2^1$. In
addition, the input and output are always of a fixed length.

In an RNN, however, this is no longer the case. Nodes in the hidden
layers are connected to themselves.

    
!split
===== Why RNNs? =====

Recurrent neural networks work very well when working with
sequential data, that is data where the order matters. In a regular
fully connected network, the order of input doesn't really matter.

Another property of  RNNs is that they can handle variable input
and output. Consider again the simplified breast cancer dataset. If you
have trained a regular FCNN on the dataset with the two features, it
makes no sense to suddenly add a third feature. The network would not
know what to do with it, and would reject such inputs with three
features (or any other number of features that isn't two, for that
matter).



!split
===== Feedback connections =====


In contrast to NNs, recurrent networks introduce feedback
connections, meaning the information is allowed to be carried to
subsequent nodes across different time steps. These cyclic or feedback
connections have the objective of providing the network with some kind
of memory, making RNNs particularly suited for time- series data,
natural language processing, speech recognition, and several other
problems for which the order of the data is crucial.  The RNN
architectures vary greatly in how they manage information flow and
memory in the network.


!split
===== Vanishing gradients =====

Different architectures often aim at improving
some sub-optimal characteristics of the network. The simplest form of
recurrent network, commonly called simple or vanilla RNN, for example,
is known to suffer from the problem of vanishing gradients. This
problem arises due to the nature of backpropagation in time. Gradients
of the cost/loss function may get exponentially small (or large) if
there are many layers in the network, which is the case of RNN when
the sequence gets long.




!split
===== Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): Overarching view =====

Till now our focus has been, including convolutional neural networks
as well, on feedforward neural networks. The output or the activations
flow only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) looks very much like a feedforward
neural network, except that it also has connections pointing
backward. 

RNNs are used to analyze time series data such as stock prices, and
tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems, they can
anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally,
they can work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on
fixed-sized inputs like all the nets we have discussed so far. For
example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio samples as
input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing
systems such as automatic translation and speech-to-text.

!split
===== Sequential data only? =====

An important issue is that in many deep learning methods we assume
that the input and output data can be treated as independent and
identically distributed, normally abbreviated to _iid_.
This means that the data we use can be seen as mutually independent.

This is however not the case for most data sets used in RNNs since we
are dealing with sequences of data with strong inter-dependencies.
This applies in particular to time series, which are sequential by
contruction.

!split
===== Differential equations =====

As an example, the solutions of ordinary differential equations can be
represented as a time series, similarly, how stock prices evolve as
function of time is another example of a typical time series, or voice
records and many other examples.


Not all sequential data may however have a time stamp, texts being a
typical example thereof, or DNA sequences.

The main focus here is on data that can be structured either as time
series or as ordered series of data.  We will not focus on for example
natural language processing or similar data sets.

===== Corresponding example using PyTorch =====

The structure of the code here is as follows
o Generate a sine function  and splits it into training and validation sets
o Create a custom data set for sequence generation
o Define an RNN model with one RNN layer and a final plain linear layer
o Train the model using the mean-squared error as cost function and the Adam optimizer
o Generate predictions using recursive forecasting
o Plot the results and training/validation loss curves

The model takes sequences of 20 previous values to predict the next
value of the sine function. The recursive prediction uses the model's own
predictions to generate future values, showing how well it maintains
the sine wave pattern over time.

The final plots show the the predicted values vs. the actual sine wave for the validation period
and the training and validation cost function curves to monitor for overfitting.

===== RNNs =====

RNNs are very powerful, because they
combine two properties:
o Distributed hidden state that allows them to store a lot of information about the past efficiently.
o Non-linear dynamics that allows them to update their hidden state in complicated ways.

With enough neurons and time, RNNs
can compute anything that can be
computed by your computer.



!split
===== What kinds of behaviour can RNNs exhibit? =====

o They can oscillate. 
o They can settle to point attractors.
o They can behave chaotically.
o RNNs could potentially learn to implement lots of small programs that each capture a nugget of knowledge and run in parallel, interacting to produce very complicated effects.

But the extensive computational needs  of RNNs makes them very hard to train.

!split
===== Solving differential equations with RNNs =====

To gain some intuition on how we can use RNNs for time series, let us
tailor the representation of the solution of a differential equation
as a time series.

Consider the famous differential equation (Newton's equation of motion for damped harmonic oscillations, scaled in terms of dimensionless time)

!bt
\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\eta\frac{dx}{dt}+x(t)=F(t),
\]
!et
where $\eta$ is a constant used in scaling time into a dimensionless variable and $F(t)$ is an external force acting on the system.
The constant $\eta$ is a so-called damping.

!split
===== Two first-order differential equations =====

In solving the above second-order equation, it is common to rewrite it in terms of two coupled first-order equations
with the velocity
!bt
\[
v(t)=\frac{dx}{dt},
\]
!et
and the acceleration
!bt
\[
\frac{dv}{dt}=F(t)-\eta v(t)-x(t).
\]
!et

With the initial conditions $v_0=v(t_0)$ and $x_0=x(t_0)$ defined, we can integrate these equations and find their respective solutions.

!split
===== Velocity only =====

Let us focus on the velocity only. Discretizing and using the simplest
possible approximation for the derivative, we have Euler's forward
method for the updated velocity at a time step $i+1$ given by
!bt
\[
v_{i+1}=v_i+\Delta t \frac{dv}{dt}_{\vert_{v=v_i}}=v_i+\Delta t\left(F_i-\eta v_i-x_i\right).
\]
!et
Defining a function
!bt
\[
h_i(x_i,v_i,F_i)=v_i+\Delta t\left(F_i-\eta v_i-x_i\right),
\]
!et
we have
!bt
\[
v_{i+1}=h_i(x_i,v_i,F_i).
\]
!et

!split
===== Linking with RNNs =====

The equation
!bt
\[
v_{i+1}=h_i(x_i,v_i,F_i).
\]
!et
can be used to train a feed-forward neural network with inputs $v_i$ and outputs $v_{i+1}$ at a time $t_i$. But we can think of this also as a recurrent neural network
with inputs $v_i$, $x_i$ and $F_i$ at each time step $t_i$, and producing an output $v_{i+1}$.

Noting that 
!bt
\[
v_{i}=v_{i-1}+\Delta t\left(F_{i-1}-\eta v_{i-1}-x_{i-1}\right)=h_{i-1}.
\]
!et
we have
!bt
\[
v_{i}=h_{i-1}(x_{i-1},v_{i-1},F_{i-1}),
\]
!et
and we can rewrite
!bt
\[
v_{i+1}=h_i(x_i,h_{i-1},F_i).
\]
!et

!split
===== Minor rewrite =====

We can thus set up a recurring series which depends on the inputs $x_i$ and $F_i$ and the previous values $h_{i-1}$.
We assume now that the inputs at each step (or time $t_i$) is given by $x_i$ only and we denote the outputs for $\tilde{y}_i$ instead of $v_{i_1}$, we have then the compact equation for our outputs at each step $t_i$
!bt
\[
y_{i}=h_i(x_i,h_{i-1}).
\]
!et

We can think of this as an element in a recurrent network where our
network (our model) produces an output $y_i$ which is then compared
with a target value through a given cost/loss function that we
optimize. The target values at a given step $t_i$ could be the results
of a measurement or simply the analytical results of a differential
equation.

!split
===== Backpropagation through time =====

!bblock
We can think of the recurrent net as a layered, feed-forward
net with shared weights and then train the feed-forward net
with weight constraints.
!eblock

We can also think of this training algorithm in the time domain:
o The forward pass builds up a stack of the activities of all the units at each time step.
o The backward pass peels activities off the stack to compute the error derivatives at each time step.
o After the backward pass we add together the derivatives at all the different times for each weight. 

!split
===== The backward pass is linear =====

o There is a big difference between the forward and backward passes.
o In the forward pass we use squashing functions (like the logistic) to prevent the activity vectors from exploding.
o The backward pass, is completely linear. If you double the error derivatives at the final layer, all the error derivatives will double.

The forward pass determines the slope of the linear function used for
backpropagating through each neuron


!split 
===== The problem of exploding or vanishing gradients =====
* What happens to the magnitude of the gradients as we backpropagate through many layers?
  o If the weights are small, the gradients shrink exponentially.
  o If the weights are big the gradients grow exponentially.
* Typical feed-forward neural nets can cope with these exponential effects because they only have a few hidden layers.
* In an RNN trained on long sequences (e.g. 100 time steps) the gradients can easily explode or vanish.
  o We can avoid this by initializing the weights very carefully.
* Even with good initial weights, its very hard to detect that the current target output depends on an input from many time-steps ago.


RNNs have difficulty dealing with long-range dependencies. 

!split
===== Mathematical setup =====

The expression for the simplest Recurrent network resembles that of a
regular feed-forward neural network, but now with
the concept of temporal dependencies

!bt
\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{a}^{(t)} & = U * \mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W * \mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}, \notag \\
    \mathbf{h}^{(t)} &= \sigma_h(\mathbf{a}^{(t)}), \notag\\
    \mathbf{y}^{(t)} &= V * \mathbf{h}^{(t)} + \mathbf{c}, \notag\\
    \mathbf{\hat{y}}^{(t)} &= \sigma_y(\mathbf{y}^{(t)}).
\end{align*}
!et

FIGURE: [figslides/RNN12.png, width=700 frac=0.9]


!split
===== Back propagation in time in equations =====

To derive the expression of the gradients of $\mathcal{L}$ for
the RNN, we need to start recursively from the nodes closer to the
output layer in the temporal unrolling scheme - such as $\mathbf{y}$
and $\mathbf{h}$ at final time $t = \tau$,

!bt
\begin{align*}
    (\nabla_{ \mathbf{y}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L})_{i} &= \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial L^{(t)}}\frac{\partial L^{(t)}}{\partial y_{i}^{(t)}}, \notag\\
    \nabla_{\mathbf{h}^{(\tau)}} \mathcal{L} &= \mathbf{V}^\mathsf{T}\nabla_{ \mathbf{y}^{(\tau)}} \mathcal{L}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Chain rule again =====
For the following hidden nodes, we have to iterate through time, so by the chain rule, 

!bt
\begin{align*}
    \nabla_{\mathbf{h}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L} &= \left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{h}^{(t+1)}}{\partial\mathbf{h}^{(t)}}\right)^\mathsf{T}\nabla_{\mathbf{h}^{(t+1)}}\mathcal{L} + \left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{y}^{(t)}}{\partial\mathbf{h}^{(t)}}\right)^\mathsf{T}\nabla_{ \mathbf{y}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Gradients of loss functions =====
Similarly, the gradients of $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the weights and biases follow,

!bt
\begin{align*}
    \nabla_{\mathbf{c}} \mathcal{L} &=\sum_{t}\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{y}^{(t)}}{\partial \mathbf{c}}\right)^\mathsf{T} \nabla_{\mathbf{y}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L} \notag\\
    \nabla_{\mathbf{b}} \mathcal{L} &=\sum_{t}\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{h}^{(t)}}{\partial \mathbf{b}}\right)^\mathsf{T}        \nabla_{\mathbf{h}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L} \notag\\
    \nabla_{\mathbf{V}} \mathcal{L} &=\sum_{t}\sum_{i}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y_i^{(t)} }\right)\nabla_{\mathbf{V}^{(t)}}y_i^{(t)} \notag\\
    \nabla_{\mathbf{W}} \mathcal{L} &=\sum_{t}\sum_{i}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial h_i^{(t)}}\right)\nabla_{\mathbf{w}^{(t)}} h_i^{(t)} \notag\\
    \nabla_{\mathbf{U}} \mathcal{L} &=\sum_{t}\sum_{i}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial h_i^{(t)}}\right)\nabla_{\mathbf{U}^{(t)}}h_i^{(t)}.
    \label{eq:rnn_gradients3}

===== Summary of RNNs =====

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have in general no probabilistic component
in a model. With a given fixed input and target from data, the RNNs learn the intermediate
association between various layers.
The inputs, outputs, and internal representation (hidden states) are all
real-valued vectors.

In a  traditional NN, it is assumed that every input is
independent of each other.  But with sequential data, the input at a given stage $t$ depends on the input from the previous stage $t-1$

!split
===== Summary of a  typical RNN =====

o Weight matrices $U$, $W$ and $V$ that connect the input layer at a stage $t$ with the hidden layer $h_t$, the previous hidden layer $h_{t-1}$ with $h_t$ and the hidden layer $h_t$ connecting with the output layer at the same stage and producing an output $\tilde{y}_t$, respectively.
o The output from the hidden layer $h_t$ is oftem modulated by a $\tanh{}$ function $h_t=\sigma_h(x_t,h_{t-1})=\tanh{(Ux_t+Wh_{t-1}+b)}$ with $b$ a bias value
o The output from the hidden layer produces $\tilde{y}_t=\sigma_y(Vh_t+c)$ where $c$ is a new bias parameter.
o The output from the training at a given stage is in turn compared with the observation $y_t$ thorugh a chosen cost function.

The function $g$ can any of the standard activation functions, that is a Sigmoid, a Softmax, a ReLU and other.
The parameters are trained through the so-called back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm.


!split
===== Four effective ways to learn an RNN  =====
o Long Short Term Memory Make the RNN out of little modules that are designed to remember values for a long time.
o Hessian Free Optimization: Deal with the vanishing gradients problem by using a fancy optimizer that can detect directions with a tiny gradient but even smaller curvature.
o Echo State Networks (ESN): Initialize the input a hidden and hidden-hidden and output-hidden connections very carefully so that the hidden state has a huge reservoir of weakly coupled oscillators which can be selectively driven by the input. ESNs only need to learn the hidden-output connections.
o Good initialization with momentum Initialize like in Echo State Networks, but then learn all of the connections using momentum

!split
===== Gating mechanism: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) =====

Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, as discussed above, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b"
and URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b".


LSTM uses a memory cell for  modeling long-range dependencies and avoid vanishing gradient  problems.
Capable of modeling longer term dependencies by having
memory cells and gates that controls the information flow along
with the memory cells.

o Introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) who solved the problem of getting an RNN to remember things for a long time (like hundreds of time steps).
o They designed a memory cell using logistic and linear units with multiplicative interactions.
o Information gets into the cell whenever its “write” gate is on.
o The information stays in the cell so long as its _keep_ gate is on.
o Information can be read from the cell by turning on its _read_ gate. 

The LSTM were first introduced to overcome the vanishing gradient problem.

To preserve information for a long time in
the activities of an RNN, we use a circuit
that implements an analog memory cell.

o A linear unit that has a self-link with a weight of 1 will maintain its state.
o Information is stored in the cell by activating its write gate.
o Information is retrieved by activating the read gate.
o We can backpropagate through this circuit because logistics are have nice derivatives. 


!split
===== LSTM details =====

The LSTM is a unit cell that is made of three gates:
o the input gate,
o the forget gate,
o and the output gate.

It also introduces a cell state $c$, which can be thought of as the
long-term memory, and a hidden state $h$ which can be thought of as
the short-term memory.

!split
===== LSTM details =====

The first stage is called the forget gate, where we combine the input
at (say, time $t$), and the hidden cell state input at $t-1$, passing
it through the Sigmoid activation function and then performing an
element-wise multiplication, denoted by $\odot$.

Mathematically we have (see also figure below)
!bt
\[
\mathbf{f}^{(t)} = \sigma(W_{fx}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{fh}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_f)
\]
!et
where the $W$s are the weights to be trained.

!split
===== The forget gate =====

The naming forget gate stems from the fact that  the Sigmoid activation function's
outputs are very close to $0$ if the argument for the function is very
negative, and $1$ if the argument is very positive. Hence we can
control the amount of information we want to take from the long-term
memory.
!bt
\[
\mathbf{f}^{(t)} = \sigma(W_{fx}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{fh}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_f)
\]
!et
where the $W$s are the weights to be trained.


!split
===== Basic layout =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM7.png, width=700 frac=1.0]

!split
===== Input gate =====

The next stage is the input gate, which consists of both a Sigmoid
function ($\sigma_i$), which decide what percentage of the input will
be stored in the long-term memory, and the $\tanh_i$ function, which
decide what is the full memory that can be stored in the long term
memory. When these results are calculated and multiplied together, it
is added to the cell state or stored in the long-term memory, denoted
as $\oplus$. 

We have
!bt
\[
\mathbf{i}^{(t)} = \sigma_g(W_{ix}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{ih}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_i),
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\mathbf{g}^{(t)} = \tanh(W_{gx}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{gh}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_g),
\]
!et
again the $W$s are the weights to train.

===== Short summary  =====

!split
===== Forget and input =====

The forget gate and the input gate together also update the cell state with the following equation, 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{c}^{(t)} = \mathbf{f}^{(t)} \otimes \mathbf{c}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{i}^{(t)} \otimes \mathbf{g}^{(t)},
\]
!et
where $f^{(t)}$ and $i^{(t)}$ are the outputs of the forget gate and the input gate, respectively.


!split
===== Basic layout =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM9.png, width=700 frac=1.0]




!split
===== Output gate =====

The final stage of the LSTM is the output gate, and its purpose is to
update the short-term memory.  To achieve this, we take the newly
generated long-term memory and process it through a hyperbolic tangent
($\tanh$) function creating a potential new short-term memory. We then
multiply this potential memory by the output of the Sigmoid function
($\sigma_o$). This multiplication generates the final output as well
as the input for the next hidden cell ($h^{\langle t \rangle}$) within
the LSTM cell.

We have 
!bt
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{o}^{(t)} &= \sigma_g(W_o\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_o\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_o), \\
\mathbf{h}^{(t)} &= \mathbf{o}^{(t)} \otimes \sigma_h(\mathbf{c}^{(t)}). \\
\end{aligned}
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{W_o,U_o}$ are the weights of the output gate and $\mathbf{b_o}$ is the bias of the output gate.

===== Summary of LSTM =====

LSTMs provide a basic approach for modeling long-range dependencies in sequences.
If you wish to read more, see _An Empirical Exploration of Recurrent Network Architectures_, authored
by Rafal Jozefowicz *et al.,*  Proceedings of ICML, 2342-2350, 2015).

An important recent development are so-called noting is a more recent
method named _gated recurrent unit (GRU)_, se for example the article
by Junyoung Chung *et al.,*, at URL:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555.
This article is an excellent read if you are interested in learning
more about these modern RNN architectures

The GRUs have a simpler
architecture than LSTMs. This leads to computationally more efficient methods, while their
performance in some tasks, such as polyphonic music modeling, is comparable to LSTMs.

And recently Beck *et al.,* see URL:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517", have demonstrated that exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.

===== LSTM implementation using TensorFlow =====

"""
Key points:
1. The input images (28x28 pixels) are treated as sequences of 28 timesteps with 28 features each
2. The LSTM layer processes this sequential data
3. A final dense layer with softmax activation handles the classification
4. Typical accuracy ranges between 95-98% (lower than CNNs but reasonable for demonstration)

Note: LSTMs are not typically used for image classification (CNNs are more efficient), but this demonstrates how to adapt them for such tasks. Training might take longer compared to CNN architectures.

To improve performance, you could:
1. Add more LSTM layers
2. Use Bidirectional LSTMs
3. Increase the number of units
4. Add dropout for regularization
5. Use learning rate scheduling

===== Dynamical ordinary differential equation =====

Let us illustrate how we could train an RNN using data from the
solution of a well-known differential equation, namely Newton's
equation for oscillatory motion for an object being forced into
harmonic oscillations by an applied external force.

We will start with the basic algorithm for solving this type of
equations using the Runge-Kutta-4 approach. The first code example is
a standalone differential equation solver. It yields positions and
velocities as function of time, starting with an initial time $t_0$
and ending with a final time.

The data the program produces will in turn be used to train an RNN for
a selected number of training data. With a trained RNN, we will then
use the network to make predictions for data not included in the
training. That is, we will train a model which should be able to
reproduce velocities and positions not included in training data.

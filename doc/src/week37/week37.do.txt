===== Gradient descent and revisiting Ordinary Least Squares from last week =====

Last week we started with  linear regression as a case study for the gradient descent
methods. Linear regression is a great test case for the gradient
descent methods discussed in the lectures since it has several
desirable properties such as:

o An analytical solution (recall homework sets for week 35).
o The gradient can be computed analytically.
o The cost function is convex which guarantees that gradient descent converges for small enough learning rates

We revisit an example similar to what we had in the first homework set. We have a function  of the type

!bc pycod
x = 2*np.random.rand(m,1)
y = 4+3*x+np.random.randn(m,1)
!ec
with $x_i \in [0,1] $ is chosen randomly using a uniform distribution. Additionally we have a stochastic noise chosen according to a normal distribution $\cal {N}(0,1)$. 
The linear regression model is given by 
!bt
\[
h_\theta(x) = \bm{y} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x,
\] 
!et
such that 
!bt
\[
\bm{y}_i = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_i.
\]
!et

!split 
===== Gradient descent example =====

Let $\mathbf{y} = (y_1,\cdots,y_n)^T$, $\mathbf{\bm{y}} = (\bm{y}_1,\cdots,\bm{y}_n)^T$ and $\theta = (\theta_0, \theta_1)^T$

It is convenient to write $\mathbf{\bm{y}} = X\theta$ where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{100 \times 2} $ is the design matrix given by (we keep the intercept here)
!bt
\[
X \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_1  \\
\vdots & \vdots  \\
1 & x_{100} &  \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
The cost/loss/risk function is given by (
!bt
\[
C(\theta) = \frac{1}{n}||X\theta-\mathbf{y}||_{2}^{2} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{100}\left[ (\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_i)^2 - 2 y_i (\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_i) + y_i^2\right] 
\]
!et
and we want to find $\theta$ such that $C(\theta)$ is minimized.

!split
===== The derivative of the cost/loss function =====

Computing $\partial C(\theta) / \partial \theta_0$ and $\partial C(\theta) / \partial \theta_1$ we can show  that the gradient can be written as
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\theta} C(\theta) = \frac{2}{n}\begin{bmatrix} \sum_{i=1}^{100} \left(\theta_0+\theta_1x_i-y_i\right) \\
\sum_{i=1}^{100}\left( x_i (\theta_0+\theta_1x_i)-y_ix_i\right) \\
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{2}{n}X^T(X\theta - \mathbf{y}), 
\]
!et
where $X$ is the design matrix defined above.

!split
===== The Hessian matrix =====
The Hessian matrix of $C(\theta)$ is given by 
!bt
\[
\bm{H} \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 C(\theta)}{\partial \theta_0^2} & \frac{\partial^2 C(\theta)}{\partial \theta_0 \partial \theta_1}  \\
\frac{\partial^2 C(\theta)}{\partial \theta_0 \partial \theta_1} & \frac{\partial^2 C(\theta)}{\partial \theta_1^2} &  \\
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{2}{n}X^T X.
\]
!et
This result implies that $C(\theta)$ is a convex function since the matrix $X^T X$ always is positive semi-definite.




!split
===== Simple program =====

We can now write a program that minimizes $C(\theta)$ using the gradient descent method with a constant learning rate $\eta$ according to 
!bt
\[
\theta_{k+1} = \theta_k - \eta \nabla_\theta C(\theta_k), \ k=0,1,\cdots 
\]
!et

We can use the expression we computed for the gradient and let use a
$\theta_0$ be chosen randomly and let $\eta = 0.001$. Stop iterating
when $||\nabla_\theta C(\theta_k) || \leq \epsilon = 10^{-8}$. _Note that the code below does not include the latter stop criterion_.

And finally we can compare our solution for $\theta$ with the analytic result given by 
$\theta= (X^TX)^{-1} X^T \mathbf{y}$.

!split 
===== Gradient descent and Ridge =====

We have also discussed Ridge regression where the loss function contains a regularized term given by the $L_2$ norm of $\theta$, 
!bt
\[
C_{\text{ridge}}(\theta) = \frac{1}{n}||X\theta -\mathbf{y}||^2 + \lambda ||\theta||^2, \ \lambda \geq 0.
\]
!et

In order to minimize $C_{\text{ridge}}(\theta)$ using GD we adjust the gradient as follows 
!bt
\[
\nabla_\theta C_{\text{ridge}}(\theta)  = \frac{2}{n}\begin{bmatrix} \sum_{i=1}^{100} \left(\theta_0+\theta_1x_i-y_i\right) \\
\sum_{i=1}^{100}\left( x_i (\theta_0+\theta_1x_i)-y_ix_i\right) \\
\end{bmatrix} + 2\lambda\begin{bmatrix} \theta_0 \\ \theta_1\end{bmatrix} = 2 (\frac{1}{n}X^T(X\theta - \mathbf{y})+\lambda \theta).
\]
!et

We can easily extend our program to minimize $C_{\text{ridge}}(\theta)$ using gradient descent and compare with the analytical solution given by 
!bt
\[
\theta_{\text{ridge}} = \left(X^T X + n\lambda I_{2 \times 2} \right)^{-1} X^T \mathbf{y}.
\]
!et

!split
===== The Hessian matrix for Ridge Regression =====
The Hessian matrix of Ridge Regression for our simple example  is given by 
!bt
\[
\bm{H} \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 C(\theta)}{\partial \theta_0^2} & \frac{\partial^2 C(\theta)}{\partial \theta_0 \partial \theta_1}  \\
\frac{\partial^2 C(\theta)}{\partial \theta_0 \partial \theta_1} & \frac{\partial^2 C(\theta)}{\partial \theta_1^2} &  \\
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{2}{n}X^T X+2\lambda\bm{I}.
\]
!et
This implies that the Hessian matrix  is positive definite, hence the stationary point is a
minimum.
Note that the Ridge cost function is convex being  a sum of two convex
functions. Therefore, the stationary point is a global
minimum of this function.

===== Using gradient descent methods, limitations =====

* _Gradient descent (GD) finds local minima of our function_. Since the GD algorithm is deterministic, if it converges, it will converge to a local minimum of our cost/loss/risk function. Because in ML we are often dealing with extremely rugged landscapes with many local minima, this can lead to poor performance.

* _GD is sensitive to initial conditions_. One consequence of the local nature of GD is that initial conditions matter. Depending on where one starts, one will end up at a different local minima. Therefore, it is very important to think about how one initializes the training process. This is true for GD as well as more complicated variants of GD.

* _Gradients are computationally expensive to calculate for large datasets_. In many cases in statistics and ML, the cost/loss/risk function is a sum of terms, with one term for each data point. For example, in linear regression, $E \propto \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \mathbf{w}^T\cdot\mathbf{x}_i)^2$; for logistic regression, the square error is replaced by the cross entropy. To calculate the gradient we have to sum over *all* $n$ data points. Doing this at every GD step becomes extremely computationally expensive. An ingenious solution to this, is to calculate the gradients using small subsets of the data called ``mini batches''. This has the added benefit of introducing stochasticity into our algorithm.

* _GD is very sensitive to choices of learning rates_. GD is extremely sensitive to the choice of learning rates. If the learning rate is very small, the training process take an extremely long time. For larger learning rates, GD can diverge and give poor results. Furthermore, depending on what the local landscape looks like, we have to modify the learning rates to ensure convergence. Ideally, we would *adaptively* choose the learning rates to match the landscape.

* _GD treats all directions in parameter space uniformly._ Another major drawback of GD is that unlike Newton's method, the learning rate for GD is the same in all directions in parameter space. For this reason, the maximum learning rate is set by the behavior of the steepest direction and this can significantly slow down training. Ideally, we would like to take large steps in flat directions and small steps in steep directions. Since we are exploring rugged landscapes where curvatures change, this requires us to keep track of not only the gradient but second derivatives. The ideal scenario would be to calculate the Hessian but this proves to be too computationally expensive. 
	
* GD can take exponential time to escape saddle points, even with random initialization. As we mentioned, GD is extremely sensitive to initial condition since it determines the particular local minimum GD would eventually reach. However, even with a good initialization scheme, through the introduction of randomness, GD can still take exponential time to escape saddle points.

===== Momentum based GD =====

We discuss here some simple examples where we introduce what is called
'memory'about previous steps, or what is normally called momentum
gradient descent.

===== Overview video on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) =====

"What is Stochastic Gradient Descent":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMh0zPT0tLI&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer"
There are several reasons for using stochastic gradient descent. Some of these are:

o Efficiency: Updates weights more frequently using a single or a small batch of samples, which speeds up convergence.
o Hopefully avoid Local Minima
o Memory Usage: Requires less memory compared to computing gradients for the entire dataset.

!split
=====  Batches and mini-batches =====

In gradient descent we compute the cost function and its gradient for all data points we have.

In large-scale applications such as the "ILSVRC challenge":"https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/", the
training data can have on order of millions of examples. Hence, it
seems wasteful to compute the full cost function over the entire
training set in order to perform only a single parameter update. A
very common approach to addressing this challenge is to compute the
gradient over batches of the training data. For example, a typical batch could contain some thousand  examples from
an  entire training set of several millions. This batch is then used to
perform a parameter update.


!split
===== Pros and cons =====


o Speed: SGD is faster than gradient descent because it uses only one training example per iteration, whereas gradient descent requires the entire dataset. This speed advantage becomes more significant as the size of the dataset increases.
o Convergence: Gradient descent has a more predictable convergence behaviour because it uses the average gradient of the entire dataset. In contrast, SGD’s convergence behaviour can be more erratic due to its random sampling of individual training examples.
o Memory: Gradient descent requires more memory than SGD because it must store the entire dataset for each iteration. SGD only needs to store the current training example, making it more memory-efficient.


!split
===== Convergence rates =====

o Stochastic Gradient Descent has a faster convergence rate due to the use of single training examples in each iteration.
o Gradient Descent as a slower convergence rate, as it uses the entire dataset for each iteration.

!split
===== Accuracy  =====

In general, stochastic Gradient Descent is Less accurate than gradient
descent, as it calculates the gradient on single examples, which may
not accurately represent the overall dataset.  Gradient Descent is
more accurate because it uses the average gradient calculated over the
entire dataset.


There are other disadvantages to using SGD. The main drawback is that
its convergence behaviour can be more erratic due to the random
sampling of individual training examples. This can lead to less
accurate results, as the algorithm may not converge to the true
minimum of the cost function. Additionally, the learning rate, which
determines the step size of each update to the model’s parameters,
must be carefully chosen to ensure convergence.

It is however the method of choice in deep learning algorithms where
SGD is often used in combination with other optimization techniques,
such as momentum or adaptive learning rates

!split
===== Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) =====

In stochastic gradient descent, the extreme case is the case where we
have only one batch, that is we include the whole data set.

This process is called Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD) (or also sometimes on-line gradient descent). This is
relatively less common to see because in practice due to vectorized
code optimizations it can be computationally much more efficient to
evaluate the gradient for 100 examples, than the gradient for one
example 100 times. Even though SGD technically refers to using a
single example at a time to evaluate the gradient, you will hear
people use the term SGD even when referring to mini-batch gradient
descent (i.e. mentions of MGD for “Minibatch Gradient Descent”, or BGD
for “Batch gradient descent” are rare to see), where it is usually
assumed that mini-batches are used. The size of the mini-batch is a
hyperparameter but it is not very common to cross-validate or bootstrap it. It is
usually based on memory constraints (if any), or set to some value,
e.g. 32, 64 or 128. We use powers of 2 in practice because many
vectorized operation implementations work faster when their inputs are
sized in powers of 2.

In our notes with  SGD we mean stochastic gradient descent with mini-batches.


!split
===== Stochastic Gradient Descent =====

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and variants thereof address some of
the shortcomings of the Gradient descent method discussed above.

The underlying idea of SGD comes from the observation that the cost
function, which we want to minimize, can almost always be written as a
sum over $n$ data points $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^n$,
!bt
\[
C(\mathbf{\theta}) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i(\mathbf{x}_i,
\mathbf{\theta}). 
\]
!et

!split
===== Computation of gradients =====

This in turn means that the gradient can be
computed as a sum over $i$-gradients 
!bt
\[
\nabla_\theta C(\mathbf{\theta}) = \sum_i^n \nabla_\theta c_i(\mathbf{x}_i,
\mathbf{\theta}).
\]
!et

Stochasticity/randomness is introduced by only taking the
gradient on a subset of the data called minibatches.  If there are $n$
data points and the size of each minibatch is $M$, there will be $n/M$
minibatches. We denote these minibatches by $B_k$ where
$k=1,\cdots,n/M$.



!split
===== SGD example =====
As an example, suppose we have $10$ data points $(\mathbf{x}_1,\cdots, \mathbf{x}_{10})$ 
and we choose to have $M=5$ minibathces,
then each minibatch contains two data points. In particular we have
$B_1 = (\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2), \cdots, B_5 =
(\mathbf{x}_9,\mathbf{x}_{10})$. Note that if you choose $M=1$ you
have only a single batch with all data points and on the other extreme,
you may choose $M=n$ resulting in a minibatch for each datapoint, i.e
$B_k = \mathbf{x}_k$.

The idea is now to approximate the gradient by replacing the sum over
all data points with a sum over the data points in one the minibatches
picked at random in each gradient descent step 
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\theta}
C(\mathbf{\theta}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \nabla_\theta c_i(\mathbf{x}_i,
\mathbf{\theta}) \rightarrow \sum_{i \in B_k}^n \nabla_\theta
c_i(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\theta}).
\]
!et

!split
===== The gradient step =====

Thus a gradient descent step now looks like 
!bt
\[
\theta_{j+1} = \theta_j - \eta_j \sum_{i \in B_k}^n \nabla_\theta c_i(\mathbf{x}_i,
\mathbf{\theta})
\]
!et

where $k$ is picked at random with equal
probability from $[1,n/M]$. An iteration over the number of
minibathces (n/M) is commonly referred to as an epoch. Thus it is
typical to choose a number of epochs and for each epoch iterate over
the number of minibatches, as exemplified in the code below.

!split
===== Simple example code =====

!bc pycod
import numpy as np 

n = 100 #100 datapoints 
M = 5   #size of each minibatch
m = int(n/M) #number of minibatches
n_epochs = 10 #number of epochs

j = 0
for epoch in range(1,n_epochs+1):
    for i in range(m):
        k = np.random.randint(m) #Pick the k-th minibatch at random
        #Compute the gradient using the data in minibatch Bk
        #Compute new suggestion for 
        j += 1
!ec

Taking the gradient only on a subset of the data has two important
benefits. First, it introduces randomness which decreases the chance
that our opmization scheme gets stuck in a local minima. Second, if
the size of the minibatches are small relative to the number of
datapoints ($M <  n$), the computation of the gradient is much
cheaper since we sum over the datapoints in the $k-th$ minibatch and not
all $n$ datapoints.

!split
===== When do we stop? =====

A natural question is when do we stop the search for a new minimum?
One possibility is to compute the full gradient after a given number
of epochs and check if the norm of the gradient is smaller than some
threshold and stop if true. However, the condition that the gradient
is zero is valid also for local minima, so this would only tell us
that we are close to a local/global minimum. However, we could also
evaluate the cost function at this point, store the result and
continue the search. If the test kicks in at a later stage we can
compare the values of the cost function and keep the $\theta$ that
gave the lowest value.

!split
===== Slightly different approach =====

Another approach is to let the step length $\eta_j$ depend on the
number of epochs in such a way that it becomes very small after a
reasonable time such that we do not move at all. Such approaches are
also called scaling. There are many such ways to "scale the learning
rate":"https://towardsdatascience.com/gradient-descent-the-learning-rate-and-the-importance-of-feature-scaling-6c0b416596e1"
and "discussions here":"https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume23/20-1258/20-1258.pdf". See
also
URL:"https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-rate-schedules-and-adaptive-learning-rate-methods-for-deep-learning-2c8f433990d1"
for a discussion of different scaling functions for the learning rate.

!split
===== Time decay rate =====

As an example, let $e = 0,1,2,3,\cdots$ denote the current epoch and let $t_0, t_1 > 0$ be two fixed numbers. Furthermore, let $t = e \cdot m + i$ where $m$ is the number of minibatches and $i=0,\cdots,m-1$. Then the function $$\eta_j(t; t_0, t_1) = \frac{t_0}{t+t_1} $$ goes to zero as the number of epochs gets large. I.e. we start with a step length $\eta_j (0; t_0, t_1) = t_0/t_1$ which decays in *time* $t$.

In this way we can fix the number of epochs, compute $\theta$ and
evaluate the cost function at the end. Repeating the computation will
give a different result since the scheme is random by design. Then we
pick the final $\theta$ that gives the lowest value of the cost
function.

!split
===== Second moment of the gradient =====


In stochastic gradient descent, with and without momentum, we still
have to specify a schedule for tuning the learning rates $\eta_t$
as a function of time.  As discussed in the context of Newton's
method, this presents a number of dilemmas. The learning rate is
limited by the steepest direction which can change depending on the
current position in the landscape. To circumvent this problem, ideally
our algorithm would keep track of curvature and take large steps in
shallow, flat directions and small steps in steep, narrow directions.
Second-order methods accomplish this by calculating or approximating
the Hessian and normalizing the learning rate by the
curvature. However, this is very computationally expensive for
extremely large models. Ideally, we would like to be able to
adaptively change the step size to match the landscape without paying
the steep computational price of calculating or approximating
Hessians.

During the last decade a number of methods have been introduced that accomplish
this by tracking not only the gradient, but also the second moment of
the gradient. These methods include AdaGrad, AdaDelta, Root Mean Squared Propagation (RMS-Prop), and
"ADAM":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980".


!split
===== Challenge: Choosing a Fixed Learning Rate =====
A fixed $\eta$ is hard to get right:
o If $\eta$ is too large, the updates can overshoot the minimum, causing oscillations or divergence
o If $\eta$ is too small, convergence is very slow (many iterations to make progress)

In practice, one often uses trial-and-error or schedules (decaying $\eta$ over time) to find a workable balance.
For a function with steep directions and flat directions, a single global $\eta$ may be inappropriate:
o Steep coordinates require a smaller step size to avoid oscillation.
o Flat/shallow coordinates could use a larger step to speed up progress.
o This issue is pronounced in high-dimensional problems with **sparse or varying-scale features** – we need a method to adjust step sizesper feature.

!split
===== Motivation for Adaptive Step Sizes =====

o Instead of a fixed global $\eta$, use an _adaptive learning rate_ for each parameter that depends on the history of gradients.
o Parameters that have large accumulated gradient magnitude should get smaller steps (they've been changing a lot), whereas parameters with small or infrequent gradients can have larger relative steps.
o This is especially useful for sparse features: Rarely active features accumulate little gradient, so their learning rate remains comparatively high, ensuring they are not neglected
o Conversely, frequently active features accumulate large gradient sums, and their learning rate automatically decreases, preventing too-large updates
o Several algorithms implement this idea (AdaGrad, RMSProp, AdaDelta, Adam, etc.). We will derive **AdaGrad**, one of the first adaptive methods.

!split
===== Derivation of the AdaGrad Algorithm =====

!bblock Accumulating Gradient History
o AdaGrad maintains a running sum of squared gradients for each parameter (coordinate)
o Let $g_t = \nabla C_{i_t}(x_t)$ be the gradient at step $t$ (or a subgradient for nondifferentiable cases).
o Initialize $r_0 = 0$ (an all-zero vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$).
o At each iteration $t$, update the accumulation:
!bt
\[
r_t =; r_{t-1} + g_t \circ g_t,
\]
!et
o Here  $g_t \circ g_t$ denotes element-wise square of the gradient vector. $g_t^{(j)} = g_{t-1}^{(j)} + (g_{t,j})^2$ for each parameter $j$.
o We can view $H_t = \mathrm{diag}(r_t)$ as a diagonal matrix of past squared gradients. Initially $H_0 = 0$.
!eblock

!split
===== AdaGrad Update Rule Derivation =====

We scale the gradient by the inverse square root of the accumulated matrix $H_t$. The AdaGrad update at step $t$ is:
!bt
\[
\theta_{t+1} =\theta_t - \eta H_t^{-1/2} g_t,
\]
!et
where $H_t^{-1/2}$ is the diagonal matrix with entries $(r_{t}^{(1)})^{-1/2}, \dots, (r_{t}^{(d)})^{-1/2}$
In coordinates, this means each parameter $j$ has an individual step size:
!bt
\[
 \theta_{t+1,j} =\theta_{t,j} -\frac{\eta}{\sqrt{r_{t,j}}}g_{t,j}.
\]
!et
In practice we add a small constant $\epsilon$ in the denominator for numerical stability to avoid division by zero:
!bt
\[
\theta_{t+1,j}= \theta_{t,j}-\frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\epsilon + r_{t,j}}}g_{t,j}.
\]
!et
Equivalently, the effective learning rate for parameter $j$ at time $t$ is $\displaystyle \alpha_{t,j} = \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\epsilon + r_{t,j}}}$. This decreases over time as $r_{t,j}$ grows.

!split
===== AdaGrad Properties =====

o AdaGrad automatically tunes the step size for each parameter. Parameters with more *volatile or large gradients* get smaller steps, and those with *small or infrequent gradients* get relatively larger steps
o No manual schedule needed: The accumulation $h_t$ keeps increasing (or stays the same if gradient is zero), so step sizes $\eta/\sqrt{r_t}$ are non-increasing. This has a similar effect to a learning rate schedule, but individualized per coordinate.
o Sparse data benefit: For very sparse features, $r_{t,j}$ grows slowly, so that feature’s parameter retains a higher learning rate for longer, allowing it to make significant updates when it does get a gradient signal
o Convergence: In convex optimization, AdaGrad can be shown to achieve a sub-linear convergence rate (e.g. $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ regret bound) comparable to the best fixed learning rate tuned for the problem

It effectively reduces the need to tune $\eta$ by hand.
o Limitations: Because $r_t$ accumulates without bound, AdaGrad’s learning rates can become extremely small over long training, potentially slowing progress. (Later variants like RMSProp, AdaDelta, Adam address this by modifying the accumulation rule.)

!split
===== RMSProp: Adaptive Learning Rates =====

Addresses AdaGrad’s diminishing learning rate issue.
Uses a decaying average of squared gradients (instead of a cumulative sum):
!bt
\[
v_t = \alpha_2 v_{t-1} + (1-\alpha_2)(\nabla C(\theta_t))^2,
\]
!et
with $\alpha_2$ typically $0.9$ (or $0.99$).
o Update: $\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{v_t + \epsilon}} \nabla C(\theta_t)$.
o Recent gradients have more weight, so $v_t$ adapts to the current landscape.
o Avoids AdaGrad’s “infinite memory” problem – learning rate does not continuously decay to zero.
RMSProp was first proposed in lecture notes by Geoff Hinton, 2012 -- unpublished.)

===== Adam Optimizer =====

Why Combine Momentum and RMSProp? Motivation for Adam: Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) was introduced by Kingma an Ba (2014) to combine the benefits of momentum and RMSProp.

o Fast convergence by smoothing gradients (accelerates in long-term gradient direction).
o Adaptive rates (RMSProp): Per-dimension learning rate scaling for stability (handles different feature scales, sparse gradients).
o Adam uses both: maintains moving averages of both first moment (gradients) and second moment (squared gradients)
o Additionally, includes a mechanism to correct the bias in these moving averages (crucial in early iterations)

_Result_: Adam is robust, achieves faster convergence with less tuning, and often outperforms SGD (with momentum) in practice.



!split
===== "ADAM optimizer":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980" =====


In "ADAM":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980", we keep a running average of
both the first and second moment of the gradient and use this
information to adaptively change the learning rate for different
parameters.  The method is efficient when working with large
problems involving lots data and/or parameters.  It is a combination of the
gradient descent with momentum algorithm and the RMSprop algorithm
discussed above.

In addition to keeping a running average of the first and
second moments of the gradient
(i.e. $\mathbf{m}_t=\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g}_t]$ and
$\mathbf{s}_t=\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g}^2_t]$, respectively), ADAM
performs an additional bias correction to account for the fact that we
are estimating the first two moments of the gradient using a running
average (denoted by the hats in the update rule below). The update
rule for ADAM is given by (where multiplication and division are once
again understood to be element-wise operations below)

!bt
\begin{align}
\mathbf{g}_t &= \nabla_\theta E(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
\mathbf{m}_t &= \theta_1 \mathbf{m}_{t-1} + (1-\theta_1) \mathbf{g}_t \nonumber \\
\mathbf{s}_t &=\theta_2 \mathbf{s}_{t-1} +(1-\theta_2)\mathbf{g}_t^2 \nonumber \\
\bm{\mathbf{m}}_t&={\mathbf{m}_t \over 1-\theta_1^t} \nonumber \\
\bm{\mathbf{s}}_t &={\mathbf{s}_t \over1-\theta_2^t} \nonumber \\
\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1}&=\boldsymbol{\theta}_t - \eta_t { \bm{\mathbf{m}}_t \over \sqrt{\bm{\mathbf{s}}_t} +\epsilon}, \nonumber \\
\end{align}
!et

where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ set the memory lifetime of the first and
second moment and are typically taken to be $0.9$ and $0.99$
respectively, and $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ are identical to RMSprop.

Like in RMSprop, the effective step size of a parameter depends on the
magnitude of its gradient squared.  To understand this better, let us
rewrite this expression in terms of the variance
$\boldsymbol{\sigma}_t^2 = \bm{\mathbf{s}}_t -
(\bm{\mathbf{m}}_t)^2$. Consider a single parameter $\theta_t$. The
update rule for this parameter is given by

!bt
\[
\Delta \theta_{t+1}= -\eta_t { \bm{m}_t \over \sqrt{\sigma_t^2 +  m_t^2 }+\epsilon}.
\]
!et

===== Practical tips =====

* _Randomize the data when making mini-batches_. It is always important to randomly shuffle the data when forming mini-batches. Otherwise, the gradient descent method can fit spurious correlations resulting from the order in which data is presented.

* _Transform your inputs_. Learning becomes difficult when our landscape has a mixture of steep and flat directions. One simple trick for minimizing these situations is to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and normalizing the variance of input variables. Whenever possible, also decorrelate the inputs. To understand why this is helpful, consider the case of linear regression. It is easy to show that for the squared error cost function, the Hessian of the cost function is just the correlation matrix between the inputs. Thus, by standardizing the inputs, we are ensuring that the landscape looks homogeneous in all directions in parameter space. Since most deep networks can be viewed as linear transformations followed by a non-linearity at each layer, we expect this intuition to hold beyond the linear case.

* _Monitor the out-of-sample performance._ Always monitor the performance of your model on a validation set (a small portion of the training data that is held out of the training process to serve as a proxy for the test set. If the validation error starts increasing, then the model is beginning to overfit. Terminate the learning process. This *early stopping* significantly improves performance in many settings.
	
* _Adaptive optimization methods don't always have good generalization._ Recent studies have shown that adaptive methods such as ADAM, RMSPorp, and AdaGrad tend to have poor generalization compared to SGD or SGD with momentum, particularly in the high-dimensional limit (i.e. the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points). Although it is not clear at this stage why these methods perform so well in training deep neural networks, simpler procedures like properly-tuned SGD may work as well or better in these applications.

=====  Sneaking in automatic differentiation using Autograd =====

In the examples here we take the liberty of sneaking in automatic
differentiation (without having discussed the mathematics).  In
project 1 you will write the gradients as discussed above, that is
hard-coding the gradients.  By introducing automatic differentiation
via the library _autograd_, which is now replaced by _JAX_, we have
more flexibility in setting up alternative cost functions.

The
first example shows results with ordinary leats squares.

===== Reminder on different scaling methods =====

Before fitting a regression model, it is good practice to normalize or
standardize the features. This ensures all features are on a
comparable scale, which is especially important when using
regularization. In the exercises this week we will perform standardization, scaling each
feature to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

Here we compute the mean and standard deviation of each column (feature) in our design/feature matrix $\bm{X}$.
Then we subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation for each feature.

In the example here we
we will also center the target $\bm{y}$ to mean $0$. Centering $\bm{y}$
(and each feature) means the model does not require a separate intercept
term, the data is shifted such that the intercept is effectively 0
. (In practice, one could include an intercept in the model and not
penalize it, but here we simplify by centering.)
Choose $n=100$ data points and set up $\bm{x}, $\bm{y}$ and the design matrix $\bm{X}$.

!bc pycod
# Standardize features (zero mean, unit variance for each feature)
X_mean = X.mean(axis=0)
X_std = X.std(axis=0)
X_std[X_std == 0] = 1  # safeguard to avoid division by zero for constant features
X_norm = (X - X_mean) / X_std

# Center the target to zero mean (optional, to simplify intercept handling)
y_mean = ?
y_centered = ?
!ec
Do we need to center the values of $y$?

After this preprocessing, each column of $\bm{X}_{\mathrm{norm}}$ has mean zero and standard deviation $1$
and $\bm{y}_{\mathrm{centered}}$ has mean 0. This can make the optimization landscape
nicer and ensures the regularization penalty $\lambda \sum_j
\theta_j^2$ in Ridge regression treats each coefficient fairly (since features are on the
same scale).

===== Functionality in Scikit-Learn =====

_Scikit-Learn_ has several functions which allow us to rescale the
data, normally resulting in much better results in terms of various
accuracy scores.  The _StandardScaler_ function in _Scikit-Learn_
ensures that for each feature/predictor we study the mean value is
zero and the variance is one (every column in the design/feature
matrix).  This scaling has the drawback that it does not ensure that
we have a particular maximum or minimum in our data set. Another
function included in _Scikit-Learn_ is the _MinMaxScaler_ which
ensures that all features are exactly between $0$ and $1$. The

!split
===== More preprocessing =====

!bblock
The _Normalizer_ scales each data
point such that the feature vector has a euclidean length of one. In other words, it
projects a data point on the circle (or sphere in the case of higher dimensions) with a
radius of 1. This means every data point is scaled by a different number (by the
inverse of it’s length).
This normalization is often used when only the direction (or angle) of the data matters,
not the length of the feature vector.

The _RobustScaler_ works similarly to the StandardScaler in that it
ensures statistical properties for each feature that guarantee that
they are on the same scale. However, the RobustScaler uses the median
and quartiles, instead of mean and variance. This makes the
RobustScaler ignore data points that are very different from the rest
(like measurement errors). These odd data points are also called
outliers, and might often lead to trouble for other scaling
techniques.

!eblock


!split
===== Frequently used scaling functions =====


Many features are often scaled using standardization to improve performance. In _Scikit-Learn_ this is given by the _StandardScaler_ function as discussed above. It is easy however to write your own. 
Mathematically, this involves subtracting the mean and divide by the standard deviation over the data set, for each feature:

!bt
\[
    x_j^{(i)} \rightarrow \frac{x_j^{(i)} - \overline{x}_j}{\sigma(x_j)},
\]
!et
where $\overline{x}_j$ and $\sigma(x_j)$ are the mean and standard deviation, respectively,  of the feature $x_j$.
This ensures that each feature has zero mean and unit standard deviation.  For data sets where  we do not have the standard deviation or don't wish to calculate it,  it is then common to simply set it to one.



Keep in mind that when you transform your data set before training a model, the same transformation needs to be done
on your eventual new data set  before making a prediction. If we translate this into a Python code, it would could be implemented as

!bc pycod
"""
#Model training, we compute the mean value of y and X
y_train_mean = np.mean(y_train)
X_train_mean = np.mean(X_train,axis=0)
X_train = X_train - X_train_mean
y_train = y_train - y_train_mean

# The we fit our model with the training data
trained_model = some_model.fit(X_train,y_train)


#Model prediction, we need also to transform our data set used for the prediction.
X_test = X_test - X_train_mean #Use mean from training data
y_pred = trained_model(X_test)
y_pred = y_pred + y_train_mean
"""
!ec



Let us try to understand what this may imply mathematically when we
subtract the mean values, also known as *zero centering*. For
simplicity, we will focus on  ordinary regression, as done in the above example.

The cost/loss function  for regression is
!bt
\[
C(\theta_0, \theta_1, ... , \theta_{p-1}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n} \left(y_i - \theta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} X_{ij}\theta_j\right)^2,.
\]
!et

Recall also that we use the squared value. This expression can lead to an
increased penalty for higher differences between predicted and
output/target values.

What we have done is to single out the $\theta_0$ term in the
definition of the mean squared error (MSE).  The design matrix $X$
does in this case not contain any intercept column.  When we take the
derivative with respect to $\theta_0$, we want the derivative to obey

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \theta_j} = 0,
\]
!et

for all $j$. For $\theta_0$ we have

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \theta_0} = -\frac{2}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(y_i - \theta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} X_{ij} \theta_j\right).
\]
!et
Multiplying away the constant $2/n$, we obtain
!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \theta_0 = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y_i - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} X_{ij} \theta_j.
\]
!et

Let us specialize first to the case where we have only two parameters $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$.
Our result for $\theta_0$ simplifies then to
!bt
\[
n\theta_0 = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y_i - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_{i1} \theta_1.
\]
!et
We obtain then
!bt
\[
\theta_0 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y_i - \theta_1\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_{i1}.
\]
!et
If we define
!bt
\[
\mu_{\bm{x}_1}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_{i1},
\]
!et
and the mean value of the outputs as
!bt
\[
\mu_y=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y_i,
\]
!et
we have
!bt
\[
\theta_0 = \mu_y - \theta_1\mu_{\bm{x}_1}.
\]
!et
In the general case with more parameters than $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$, we have
!bt
\[
\theta_0 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y_i - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=1}^{p-1} X_{ij}\theta_j.
\]
!et

We can rewrite the latter equation as
!bt
\[
\theta_0 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y_i - \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} \mu_{\bm{x}_j}\theta_j,
\]
!et
where we have defined
!bt
\[
\mu_{\bm{x}_j}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_{ij},
\]
!et
the mean value for all elements of the column vector $\bm{x}_j$.



Replacing $y_i$ with $y_i - y_i - \overline{\bm{y}}$ and centering also our design matrix results in a cost function (in vector-matrix disguise)
!bt
\[
C(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = (\boldsymbol{\tilde{y}} - \tilde{X}\boldsymbol{\theta})^T(\boldsymbol{\tilde{y}} - \tilde{X}\boldsymbol{\theta}). 
\]
!et



If we minimize with respect to $\bm{\theta}$ we have then

!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\theta}} = (\tilde{X}^T\tilde{X})^{-1}\tilde{X}^T\boldsymbol{\tilde{y}},
\]
!et

where $\boldsymbol{\tilde{y}} = \boldsymbol{y} - \overline{\bm{y}}$
and $\tilde{X}_{ij} = X_{ij} - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}X_{kj}$.

For Ridge regression we need to add $\lambda \boldsymbol{\theta}^T\boldsymbol{\theta}$ to the cost function and get then
!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\theta}} = (\tilde{X}^T\tilde{X} + \lambda I)^{-1}\tilde{X}^T\boldsymbol{\tilde{y}}.
\]
!et

What does this mean? And why do we insist on all this? Let us look at some examples.


This code shows a simple first-order fit to a data set using the above transformed data, where we consider the role of the intercept first, by either excluding it or including it (*code example thanks to  Øyvind Sigmundson Schøyen*). Here our scaling of the data is done by subtracting the mean values only.
Note also that we do not split the data into training and test.

The intercept is the value of our output/target variable
when all our features are zero and our function crosses the $y$-axis (for a one-dimensional case). 

Printing the MSE, we see first that both methods give the same MSE, as
they should.  However, when we move to for example Ridge regression,
the way we treat the intercept may give a larger or smaller MSE,
meaning that the MSE can be penalized by the value of the
intercept. Not including the intercept in the fit, means that the
regularization term does not include $\theta_0$. For different values
of $\lambda$, this may lead to different MSE values. 

To remind the reader, the regularization term, with the intercept in Ridge regression, is given by
!bt
\[
\lambda \vert\vert \bm{\theta} \vert\vert_2^2 = \lambda \sum_{j=0}^{p-1}\theta_j^2,
\]
!et
but when we take out the intercept, this equation becomes
!bt
\[
\lambda \vert\vert \bm{\theta} \vert\vert_2^2 = \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p-1}\theta_j^2.
\]
!et

For Lasso regression we have
!bt
\[
\lambda \vert\vert \bm{\theta} \vert\vert_1 = \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p-1}\vert\theta_j\vert.
\]
!et

It means that, when scaling the design matrix and the outputs/targets,
by subtracting the mean values, we have an optimization problem which
is not penalized by the intercept. The MSE value can then be smaller
since it focuses only on the remaining quantities. If we however bring
back the intercept, we will get a MSE which then contains the
intercept.


Armed with this wisdom, we attempt first to simply set the intercept equal to _False_ in our implementation of Ridge regression for our well-known  vanilla data set.

The results here agree when we force _Scikit-Learn_'s Ridge function to include the first column in our design matrix.
We see that the results agree very well. Here we have thus explicitely included the intercept column in the design matrix.
What happens if we do not include the intercept in our fit?
Let us see how we can change this code by zero centering.

We see here, when compared to the code which includes explicitely the
intercept column, that our MSE value is actually smaller. This is
because the regularization term does not include the intercept value
$\theta_0$ in the fitting.  This applies to Lasso regularization as
well.  It means that our optimization is now done only with the
centered matrix and/or vector that enter the fitting procedure.

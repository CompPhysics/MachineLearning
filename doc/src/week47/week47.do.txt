===== What is a recurrent NN? =====

A recurrent neural network (RNN), as opposed to a regular fully
connected neural network (FCNN) or just neural network (NN), has
layers that are connected to themselves.
    

In an FCNN there are no connections between nodes in a single
layer. For instance, $(h_1^1$ is not connected to $(h_2^1$. In
addition, the input and output are always of a fixed length.

In an RNN, however, this is no longer the case. Nodes in the hidden
layers are connected to themselves.

    
!split
===== Why RNNs? =====

Recurrent neural networks work very well when working with
sequential data, that is data where the order matters. In a regular
fully connected network, the order of input doesn't really matter.

Another property of  RNNs is that they can handle variable input
and output. Consider again the simplified breast cancer dataset. If you
have trained a regular FCNN on the dataset with the two features, it
makes no sense to suddenly add a third feature. The network would not
know what to do with it, and would reject such inputs with three
features (or any other number of features that isn't two, for that
matter).

===== The mathematics of RNNs, the basic architecture  =====

!split
===== Gating mechanism: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) =====

Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, as discussed above, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b"
and URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b".


LSTM uses a memory cell for  modeling long-range dependencies and avoid vanishing gradient  problems.
Capable of modeling longer term dependencies by having
memory cells and gates that controls the information flow along
with the memory cells.

o Introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) who solved the problem of getting an RNN to remember things for a long time (like hundreds of time steps).
o They designed a memory cell using logistic and linear units with multiplicative interactions.
o Information gets into the cell whenever its “write” gate is on.
o The information stays in the cell so long as its _keep_ gate is on.
o Information can be read from the cell by turning on its _read_ gate. 

The LSTM were first introduced to overcome the vanishing gradient problem.

!split
===== Implementing a memory cell in a neural network =====

To preserve information for a long time in
the activities of an RNN, we use a circuit
that implements an analog memory cell.

o A linear unit that has a self-link with a weight of 1 will maintain its state.
o Information is stored in the cell by activating its write gate.
o Information is retrieved by activating the read gate.
o We can backpropagate through this circuit because logistics are have nice derivatives. 


!split
===== LSTM details =====

The LSTM is a unit cell that is made of three gates:
o the input gate,
o the forget gate,
o and the output gate.

It also introduces a cell state $c$, which can be thought of as the
long-term memory, and a hidden state $h$ which can be thought of as
the short-term memory.


!split
===== Basic layout (All figures from Raschka *et al.,*) =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM1.png, width=700 frac=1.0]


!split
===== LSTM details =====

The first stage is called the forget gate, where we combine the input
at (say, time $t$), and the hidden cell state input at $t-1$, passing
it through the Sigmoid activation function and then performing an
element-wise multiplication, denoted by $\odot$.

Mathematically we have (see also figure below)
!bt
\[
\mathbf{f}^{(t)} = \sigma(W_{fx}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{fh}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_f)
\]
!et
where the $W$s are the weights to be trained.

!split
===== Forget gate  =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM6.png, width=700 frac=1.0]

!split
===== The forget gate =====

The naming forget gate stems from the fact that  the Sigmoid activation function's
outputs are very close to $0$ if the argument for the function is very
negative, and $1$ if the argument is very positive. Hence we can
control the amount of information we want to take from the long-term
memory.
!bt
\[
\mathbf{f}^{(t)} = \sigma(W_{fx}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{fh}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_f)
\]
!et
where the $W$s are the weights to be trained.


!split
===== Basic layout =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM7.png, width=700 frac=1.0]

!split
===== Input gate =====

The next stage is the input gate, which consists of both a Sigmoid
function ($\sigma_i$), which decide what percentage of the input will
be stored in the long-term memory, and the $\tanh_i$ function, which
decide what is the full memory that can be stored in the long term
memory. When these results are calculated and multiplied together, it
is added to the cell state or stored in the long-term memory, denoted
as $\oplus$. 

We have
!bt
\[
\mathbf{i}^{(t)} = \sigma_g(W_{ix}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{ih}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_i),
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\mathbf{g}^{(t)} = \tanh(W_{gx}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{gh}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_g),
\]
!et
again the $W$s are the weights to train.




!split
===== Short summary  =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM8.png, width=700 frac=1.0]


!split
===== Forget and input =====

The forget gate and the input gate together also update the cell state with the following equation, 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{c}^{(t)} = \mathbf{f}^{(t)} \otimes \mathbf{c}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{i}^{(t)} \otimes \mathbf{g}^{(t)},
\]
!et
where $f^{(t)}$ and $i^{(t)}$ are the outputs of the forget gate and the input gate, respectively.


!split
===== Basic layout =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM9.png, width=700 frac=1.0]




!split
===== Output gate =====

The final stage of the LSTM is the output gate, and its purpose is to
update the short-term memory.  To achieve this, we take the newly
generated long-term memory and process it through a hyperbolic tangent
($\tanh$) function creating a potential new short-term memory. We then
multiply this potential memory by the output of the Sigmoid function
($\sigma_o$). This multiplication generates the final output as well
as the input for the next hidden cell ($h^{\langle t \rangle}$) within
the LSTM cell.

We have 
!bt
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{o}^{(t)} &= \sigma_g(W_o\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_o\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_o), \\
\mathbf{h}^{(t)} &= \mathbf{o}^{(t)} \otimes \sigma_h(\mathbf{c}^{(t)}). \\
\end{aligned}
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{W_o,U_o}$ are the weights of the output gate and $\mathbf{b_o}$ is the bias of the output gate.

===== Summary of LSTM =====

LSTMs provide a basic approach for modeling long-range dependencies in sequences.
If you wish to read more, see _An Empirical Exploration of Recurrent Network Architectures_, authored
by Rafal Jozefowicz *et al.,*  Proceedings of ICML, 2342-2350, 2015).

An important recent development are the so-called _gated recurrent units (GRU)_, see for example the article
by Junyoung Chung *et al.,*, at URL:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555.
This article is an excellent read if you are interested in learning
more about these modern RNN architectures

The GRUs have a simpler
architecture than LSTMs. This leads to computationally more efficient methods, while their
performance in some tasks, such as polyphonic music modeling, is comparable to LSTMs.

===== LSTM implementation using TensorFlow =====

!bc pycod
"""
Key points:
1. The input images (28x28 pixels) are treated as sequences of 28 timesteps with 28 features each
2. The LSTM layer processes this sequential data
3. A final dense layer with softmax activation handles the classification
4. Typical accuracy ranges between 95-98% (lower than CNNs but reasonable for demonstration)

Note: LSTMs are not typically used for image classification (CNNs are more efficient), but this demonstrates how to adapt them for such tasks. Training might take longer compared to CNN architectures.

To improve performance, you could:
1. Add more LSTM layers
2. Use Bidirectional LSTMs
3. Increase the number of units
4. Add dropout for regularization
5. Use learning rate scheduling

===== Dynamical ordinary differential equation =====

Let us illustrate how we could train an RNN using data from the
solution of a well-known differential equation, namely Newton's
equation for oscillatory motion for an object being forced into
harmonic oscillations by an applied external force.

We will start with the basic algorithm for solving this type of
equations using the Runge-Kutta-4 approach. The first code example is
a standalone differential equation solver. It yields positions and
velocities as function of time, starting with an initial time $t_0$
and ending with a final time.

The data the program produces will in turn be used to train an RNN for
a selected number of training data. With a trained RNN, we will then
use the network to make predictions for data not included in the
training. That is, we will train a model which should be able to
reproduce velocities and positions not included in training data.

Simple RNN Lecture Series

Lecture 1: Introduction to Simple RNNs

\begin{frame}{Why Recurrent Networks?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Traditional feedforward networks process fixed-size inputs and ignore temporal order. RNNs incorporate recurrence to handle sequential data like time series or language ￼.
\item At each time step, an RNN cell processes input x_t and a hidden state h_{t-1} from the previous step, producing a new hidden state h_t and (optionally) an output y_t.
\item This hidden state acts as a “memory” carrying information forward. For example, predicting stock prices or words in a sentence relies on past inputs ￼ ￼.
\item RNNs share parameters across time steps, so they can generalize patterns regardless of sequence length ￼.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RNN Forward Pass Equations}
	•	For a simple (vanilla) RNN with one hidden layer and no bias, the state update and output are:
\mathbf{h}_t = \phi(\mathbf{W}_{xh}\mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{W}_{hh}\mathbf{h}_{t-1})\,,\quad
\mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{W}_{yh}\mathbf{h}_t\,,
where \phi is a nonlinear activation (e.g. tanh or ReLU) ￼.
	•	In matrix form, \mathbf{W}_{xh}\in\mathbb{R}^{h\times d}, \mathbf{W}_{hh}\in\mathbb{R}^{h\times h}, \mathbf{W}_{yh}\in\mathbb{R}^{q\times h} for input dim d, hidden dim h, output dim q ￼.
	•	We often also write y_t = f(\mathbf{o}_t) with \mathbf{o}_t=W_{yh}h_t to include a final activation for classification.
	•	Because the same \mathbf{W} are used each step, gradients during training will propagate through time (see Lecture 2).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unrolled RNN in Time}

\begin{itemize}
\item The diagram above shows an RNN cell unrolled over three time steps. Each copy of the cell shares the same weights ￼.
\item Input x_1,x_2,x_3 feed sequentially; the hidden state flows from one step to the next, capturing past context.
\item After processing the final input x_T, the network can make a prediction (many-to-one) or outputs can be produced at each step (many-to-many).
\item Unrolling clarifies that training an RNN is like training a deep feedforward network of depth T, with recurrent connections tying layers together ￼.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example Task: Character-level RNN Classification}
\begin{itemize}
\item A classic example: feed a name (sequence of characters) one char at a time, and classify its language of origin.
\item At each step, the RNN outputs a hidden state; we use the final hidden state to predict the class of the entire sequence ￼.
\item “A character-level RNN reads words as a series of characters—outputting a prediction and ‘hidden state’ at each step, feeding the previous hidden state into the next step. We take the final prediction to be the output” ￼.
\item This illustrates sequence-to-one modeling: every output depends on all previous inputs.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{PyTorch: Defining a Simple RNN}
\begin{lstlisting}
import torch, torch.nn as nn

A simple RNN-based model

model = nn.Sequential(
nn.RNN(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, num_layers=2, batch_first=True),
nn.Linear(20, 5)  # 5 output classes
)

Example input: batch of 3 sequences, each of length 7, input dim 10

x = torch.randn(3, 7, 10)
output, hn = model(x)  # output shape: (3,7,20), hn shape: (2,3,20)
\end{lstlisting}
	•	PyTorch’s nn.RNN(in_features, hidden_size, num_layers) stacks RNN layers (here 2) ￼.
	•	The output tensor has shape (batch, seq_len, hidden_size); hn contains the last hidden states for each layer.
	•	This code example is adapted from PyTorch docs ￼ ￼.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{TensorFlow: Defining a Simple RNN}
\begin{lstlisting}
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

Sequential model with a single SimpleRNN layer

model = models.Sequential([
layers.SimpleRNN(64, input_shape=(None, 10), activation=‘tanh’),
layers.Dense(5, activation=‘softmax’)
])
model.summary()
\end{lstlisting}
	•	This Keras model takes variable-length sequences of 10-dimensional inputs; the SimpleRNN(64) layer returns a 64-dim vector.
	•	We then use a dense output for classification. TensorFlow usage example:
model.add(layers.SimpleRNN(128)) produces output shape (None,128) ￼.
	•	Both frameworks require you to handle batching and sequence lengths (e.g., batch_first=True in PyTorch makes input shape (batch,seq,features), whereas in TensorFlow Keras, batch is first by default ￼).
\end{frame}

Lecture 2: Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and Gradients

\begin{frame}{Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Training an RNN involves computing gradients through time by unfolding the network: treat the unrolled RNN as a very deep feedforward net.
\item We compute the loss L = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \ell(y_t,\hat y_t) and backpropagate from t=T down to t=1.
\item The computational graph below (for 3 steps) shows how each hidden state depends on inputs and parameters across time ￼.
\item BPTT applies the chain rule along this graph, accumulating gradients from each time step into the shared parameters.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RNN Computational Graph}

\begin{itemize}
\item Boxes (variables) and circles (operations) illustrate dependencies: each h_t depends on W_{xh},W_{hh}, h_{t-1}, x_t ￼.
\item During the backward pass, we traverse this graph in reverse, summing gradients that flow from future time steps.
\item Note how the hidden state paths merge: gradients at step t come from both the loss at t and from the next step t+1.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Gradient Computation (BPTT Equations)}
	•	Let L be the total loss. For the final time step T,
\frac{\partial L}{\partial h_T} = W_{yh}^T \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_T} using y_T=W_{yh}h_T ￼.
	•	For any intermediate step t<T, the gradient w.r.t. the hidden state obeys the recurrence:
\displaystyle\frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t} = W_{hh}^T\frac{\partial L}{\partial h_{t+1}} + W_{yh}^T\frac{\partial L}{\partial y_t} ￼.
	•	In words: error from the future step (\partial L/\partial h_{t+1}) is backpropagated through W_{hh}, and error from current output is backpropagated through W_{yh}.
	•	The gradients for the parameters are sums over time: e.g., \partial L/\partial W_{yh} = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_t}h_t^T ￼ and similar for W_{xh},W_{hh}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exploding and Vanishing Gradients}
	•	Unfolded BPTT shows gradients involve powers of W_{hh}. For example, expanding the recurrence gives terms like (W_{hh}^T)^{k} multiplying gradients from k steps ahead ￼.
	•	Vanishing gradients: If \|W_{hh}\|<1 (eigenvalues <1), repeated multiplications shrink gradients exponentially, making it hard to learn long-range dependencies.
	•	Exploding gradients: If \|W_{hh}\|>1, gradients grow exponentially, causing instability.
	•	As noted: “eigenvalues smaller than 1 vanish and eigenvalues larger than 1 diverge. This is numerically unstable… manifesting as vanishing and exploding gradients.” ￼.
	•	In practice, one mitigates this by careful weight initialization and gradient clipping (e.g., clip_grad_norm_ in PyTorch), or by truncating BPTT.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Truncated BPTT and Gradient Clipping}
\begin{itemize}
\item Truncated BPTT: Instead of backpropagating through all T steps, we may backpropagate through a fixed window of length \tau. This approximates the full gradient and reduces computation ￼.
\item Concretely, one computes gradients up to \tau steps and treats gradients beyond as zero. This still allows learning short-term patterns efficiently.
\item Gradient Clipping: Cap the gradient norm to a maximum value to prevent explosion. For example in PyTorch:
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0) ensures \|\nabla\|\le1.
\item These techniques help stabilize training, but the fundamental vanishing problem motivates using alternative RNN cells (LSTM/GRU) in practice (though we do not cover them here).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mathematical Insight on Gradients}
	•	In a linearized RNN, one can derive (9.7.15) showing \partial L/\partial h_t = \sum_{i=t}^T (W_{hh}^T)^{T-i} W_{yh}^T \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_{T+t-i}} ￼.
	•	From this, any eigenvalue \lambda of W_{hh} contributes factors \lambda^{T-t} to gradients. If |\lambda|<1, terms vanish as T\to\infty; if |\lambda|>1, they explode.
	•	Thus, simple RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies: information far back in time has negligible influence on the loss gradient ￼.
	•	Truncation effectively ignores terms beyond a window, trading off accuracy for stability.
\end{frame}

Lecture 3: Applications of Simple RNNs

\begin{frame}{RNNs for Time Series Forecasting}
\begin{itemize}
\item Forecasting: RNNs can predict future values from historical data. Example tasks include stock prices, weather patterns, or any temporal signal ￼.
\item By feeding in sequence \{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_T\}, an RNN can output a prediction y_T (one-step ahead) or even a full sequence \{y_2,\dots,y_{T+1}\}.
\item Unlike linear models, RNNs can capture complex temporal patterns (trends, seasonality, autocorrelation) in a data-driven way ￼.
\item Preprocessing (normalization, sliding windows) is important. Split data into train/test by time (no shuffling).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sequence Modeling Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many-to-One: Classify or predict one value from an entire sequence (e.g., sentiment analysis of a movie review, or classifying a time series). We use the final hidden state as a summary of the sequence.
\item Many-to-Many (Prediction): Predict an output at each time step (e.g., language modeling or sequential regression). RNN outputs are used at each step.
\item Encoder–Decoder (Seq2Seq): (Advanced) Map input sequences to output sequences of different lengths. Though typically LSTM-based, it’s conceptually possible with simple RNNs.
\item RNNs also apply to physics and biology: e.g., modeling dynamical systems, protein sequences, or neuroscience time series. Any domain with sequential data can use RNN-based modeling.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{PyTorch Example: Time Series Regression}
\begin{lstlisting}
import torch.nn as nn

Simple RNN for sequence-to-value regression

class ForecastRNN(nn.Module):
def init(self, input_dim, hidden_dim):
super().init()
self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)
def forward(self, x):
out, _ = self.rnn(x)         # out: (batch, seq_len, hidden_dim)
return self.fc(out[:, -1, :])  # use last output for prediction

model = ForecastRNN(input_dim=1, hidden_dim=20)
x = torch.randn(16, 10, 1)  # batch=16, seq_len=10
y_pred = model(x)  # shape (16,1)
\end{lstlisting}
	•	This RNN reads 10 time steps of a univariate series and outputs a single prediction (one-step ahead).
	•	We apply a linear layer to the last RNN output (out[:,-1,:]) to make the forecast.
	•	Training would minimize MSE between y_pred and true next value.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{TensorFlow Example: Time Series Regression}
\begin{lstlisting}
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
layers.SimpleRNN(20, input_shape=(None, 1), activation=‘tanh’),
layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(loss=‘mse’, optimizer=‘adam’)
model.summary()
\end{lstlisting}
	•	Here SimpleRNN(20) processes sequences of shape (batch, seq_len, 1), outputting a 20-dimensional vector for the last time step.
	•	We then predict a single value with Dense(1). The model is compiled with mean-squared error for regression.
	•	This aligns with the PyTorch example: both frameworks allow easy stacking of an RNN layer followed by a Dense layer for output.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Other Sequence Applications}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sequence Classification: Use RNN hidden state for class labels. For example, classify a time series into anomaly vs normal.
\item Sequence Labeling: Predict labels at each time step (e.g. part-of-speech tagging). The RNN outputs a vector at each step passed through a classification layer.
\item Language and Text: (Advanced) Character or word-level models use RNNs to generate text or classify documents. E.g., predicting next character from previous ones (RNN language model) ￼.
\item Physically Motivated Data: RNNs can model dynamical systems (e.g., rolling ball trajectories, neuron spikes over time, climate data). They learn temporal patterns directly from data without explicit equations.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Training and Practical Tips}
\begin{itemize}
\item Loss Functions: Use MSE for regression tasks, cross-entropy for classification tasks. Sum or average losses over time steps as needed.
\item Batching Sequences: Handle variable-length sequences by padding or using masking. PyTorch pack_padded_sequence or Keras masking can help.
\item Optimization: Standard optimizers (SGD, Adam) work. Learning rate may need tuning due to sequential correlations.
\item Initial Hidden State: Usually initialized to zeros. Can also learn an initial state or carry hidden state across batches for very long sequences (stateful=True in Keras).
\item Regularization: Dropout can be applied to inputs or recurrent states (PyTorch/RNN has dropout option; Keras has dropout/recurrent_dropout).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

Lecture 4: Advanced Topics in Simple RNNs

\begin{frame}{Stacked (Deep) RNNs}

\begin{itemize}
\item In a deep RNN, multiple RNN layers are stacked: the output of layer l-1 at time t feeds into layer l at the same time (see Fig. 10.3.1) ￼.
\item Formally, for layer l: H_t^{(l)} = \phi\big(H_t^{(l-1)}W_{xh}^{(l)} + H_{t-1}^{(l)}W_{hh}^{(l)} + b_h^{(l)}\big) ￼.
\item Stacking increases model capacity, allowing complex input-to-output transformations and temporal modeling.
\item In code (PyTorch), use num_layers>1 or explicitly stack nn.RNN layers ￼. In Keras, add multiple SimpleRNN layers with return_sequences=True on all but the last.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bidirectional RNNs (Brief Mention)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Though beyond “simple” RNNs, note: Bidirectional RNNs process the sequence forward and backward, concatenating both hidden states. Useful when entire sequence is known (e.g. offline tasks).
\item In PyTorch: nn.RNN(..., bidirectional=True) makes a 2-directional RNN. In Keras: layers.Bidirectional(layers.SimpleRNN(...)).
\item This doubles parameters and output size but can improve context capture. However, it still uses simple RNN cells internally (no gates).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Parameter and Output Shapes}
\begin{itemize}
\item For PyTorch’s nn.RNN, inputs shape (batch, seq_len, input_dim) (with batch_first=True) ￼; output is (batch, seq_len, hidden_size).
\item Keras SimpleRNN(units, input_shape=(None,input_dim)) outputs shape (batch, units) by default (last output). To get full sequences, use return_sequences=True.
\item Hidden state tensor shapes: PyTorch returns h_n of shape (num_layers * num_directions, batch, hidden_size).
\item Always check framework docs for exact conventions (e.g., PyTorch’s batch_first flag) ￼ ￼.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Limitations and Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Vanishing Gradients: Simple RNNs have fundamental difficulty learning long-term dependencies due to gradient decay ￼.
\item Capacity: Without gates, RNNs may struggle with tasks requiring remembering far-back inputs. Training can be slow as it’s inherently sequential.
\item Alternatives: In practice, gated RNNs (LSTM/GRU) or Transformers are often used for long-range dependencies. However, simple RNNs are still instructive and sometimes sufficient for short sequences ￼ ￼.
\item Regularization: Weight decay or dropout (on inputs/states) can help generalization but must be applied carefully due to temporal correlations.
\item Statefulness: For very long sequences, one can preserve hidden state across batches (stateful RNN) to avoid resetting memory.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Summary of Forward/Backward}
\begin{itemize}
\item Forward pass: h_t = \phi(W_{xh} x_t + W_{hh} h_{t-1} + b), y_t = W_{yh} h_t + c ￼.
\item Backward pass (BPTT): Gradients flow as
\frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t} = W_{hh}^T \frac{\partial L}{\partial h_{t+1}} + W_{yh}^T \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_t} ￼, accumulating through time.
\item Training: Use gradient descent (SGD, Adam, etc.) to update weights W. Monitor for vanishing/exploding gradients and use clipping or truncation as needed ￼ ￼.
\item Usage: RNNs excel at modeling sequences with short- to mid-term dependencies. They have been widely used in time series, NLP, and any domain with temporal structure ￼ ￼.
\end{itemize}

PyTorch RNN Time Series Example

We first implement a simple RNN in PyTorch to forecast a univariate time series (a sine wave). The steps are: (1) generate synthetic data and form input/output sequences; (2) define an nn.RNN model; (3) train the model with MSE loss and an optimizer; (4) evaluate on a held-out test set. For example, using a sine wave as in prior tutorials ￼, we create sliding windows of length seq_length. The code below shows each step. We use nn.RNN (the basic recurrent layer) followed by a linear output. The training loop (with MSELoss and Adam) updates the model to minimize prediction error ￼.

import numpy as np

X, y = [], []
for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
    X.append(data[i:i+seq_length])         # sequence of length seq_length
    y.append(data[i+seq_length])           # next value to predict
X = np.array(X)                            # shape (480, seq_length)
y = np.array(y)                            # shape (480,)

y_test  = torch.tensor(y[train_size:],  dtype=torch.float32)

# 2. Model definition: simple RNN followed by a linear layer
class SimpleRNNModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=1, hidden_size=16, num_layers=1):
        super(SimpleRNNModel, self).__init__()
        # nn.RNN for sequential data (batch_first=True expects (batch, seq_len, features))
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)    # output layer for prediction

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)                 # out: (batch, seq_len, hidden_size)
        out = out[:, -1, :]                  # take output of last time step
        return self.fc(out)                 # linear layer to 1D output

model = SimpleRNNModel(input_size=1, hidden_size=16, num_layers=1)
print(model)  # print model summary (structure)
# Output example:
# SimpleRNNModel(
#   (rnn): RNN(1, 16, batch_first=True)
#   (fc): Linear(in_features=16, out_features=1, bias=True)
# )

	•	Model Explanation: Here input_size=1 because each time step has one feature. The RNN hidden state has size 16, and batch_first=True means input tensors have shape (batch, seq_len, features). We take the last RNN output and feed it through a linear layer to predict the next value ￼.

# 3. Training loop: MSE loss and Adam optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()                  # mean squared error loss
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

epochs = 50
for epoch in range(1, epochs+1):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(X_train)               # forward pass
    loss = criterion(output, y_train)     # compute training loss
    loss.backward()                       # backpropagate
    optimizer.step()                      # update weights
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {epoch}/{epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
# Sample output:
# Epoch 10/50, Loss: 0.3604
# Epoch 20/50, Loss: 0.0542
# Epoch 30/50, Loss: 0.0207
# Epoch 40/50, Loss: 0.0102
# Epoch 50/50, Loss: 0.0065

	•	Training Details: We train for 50 epochs, printing the training loss every 10 epochs. As training proceeds, the loss (MSE) typically decreases, indicating the RNN is learning the sine-wave pattern ￼.

# 4. Evaluation on test set
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    pred = model(X_test)
    test_loss = criterion(pred, y_test)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss.item():.4f}')

# (Optional) View a few actual vs. predicted values
print("Actual:", y_test[:5].flatten().numpy())
print("Pred : ", pred[:5].flatten().numpy())

	•	Evaluation: We switch to eval mode and compute loss on the test set. The lower test loss indicates how well the model generalizes. The code prints a few sample predictions against actual values for qualitative assessment. This simple PyTorch RNN code closely follows known tutorials ￼.

TensorFlow (Keras) RNN Time Series Example

Next, we use TensorFlow/Keras to do the same task. We build a tf.keras.Sequential model with a SimpleRNN layer (the most basic recurrent layer) ￼ followed by a Dense output. The workflow is similar: create the same synthetic sine data and split it into train/test sets; then define, train, and evaluate the model.

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# 1. Data preparation: same sine wave data and sequences as above
time_steps = np.linspace(0, 100, 500)
data = np.sin(time_steps)                     # (500,)
seq_length = 20
X, y = [], []
for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
    X.append(data[i:i+seq_length])
    y.append(data[i+seq_length])
X = np.array(X)                               # (480, seq_length)
y = np.array(y)                               # (480,)
# reshape for RNN: (samples, timesteps, features)
X = X.reshape(-1, seq_length, 1)             # (480, 20, 1)
y = y.reshape(-1, 1)                         # (480, 1)

# Split into train/test (80/20)
split = int(0.8 * len(X))
X_train, X_test = X[:split], X[split:]
y_train, y_test = y[:split], y[split:]

	•	Data: We use the same sine-wave sequence and sliding-window split as in the PyTorch example ￼. The arrays are reshaped to (batch, timesteps, features) for Keras.

# 2. Model definition: Keras SimpleRNN and Dense
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(16, input_shape=(seq_length, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')   # MSE loss and Adam optimizer
model.summary()
# Output example:
# Model: "sequential"
# _________________________________________________________________
# Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   
# =================================================================
# simple_rnn (SimpleRNN)      (None, 16)                 288       
# _________________________________________________________________
# dense (Dense)              (None, 1)                   17        
# =================================================================

	•	Model Explanation: Here SimpleRNN(16) creates 16 recurrent units. The model summary shows the shapes and number of parameters. (Keras handles the sequence dimension internally.)

# 3. Training
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=50,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_split=0.2,    # use 20% of train data for validation
    verbose=1
)
# Training progress prints loss/val_loss each epoch

	•	Training: We train for 50 epochs. The fit call also reports validation loss (using a 20% split of the training data) to monitor generalization. (This follows the standard Keras approach ￼.)

# 4. Evaluation on test set
test_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}')

# (Optional) Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Actual:", y_test.flatten()[:5])
print("Pred : ", predictions.flatten()[:5])

	•	Evaluation: After training, we call model.evaluate on the test set. A low test loss indicates good forecasting accuracy. We also predict and compare a few samples of actual vs. predicted values. This completes the simple RNN forecasting example in TensorFlow.

Both examples use only basic RNN cells (no LSTM/GRU) and include data preparation, model definition, training loop, and evaluation. The PyTorch code uses nn.RNN as in common tutorials ￼ ￼, and the Keras code uses SimpleRNN layer ￼. Each code block above is self-contained and can be run independently with standard libraries (NumPy, PyTorch or TensorFlow).

Sources: We adapted the PyTorch example from a tutorial using a sine-wave dataset ￼ ￼ ￼, and the Keras steps follow standard time-series RNN usage ￼ ￼.

!split
===== What is a recurrent NN? =====

A recurrent neural network (RNN), as opposed to a regular fully
connected neural network (FCNN) or just neural network (NN), has
layers that are connected to themselves.
    

In an FCNN there are no connections between nodes in a single
layer. For instance, $(h_1^1$ is not connected to $(h_2^1$. In
addition, the input and output are always of a fixed length.

In an RNN, however, this is no longer the case. Nodes in the hidden
layers are connected to themselves.

    
!split
===== Why RNNs? =====

Recurrent neural networks work very well when working with
sequential data, that is data where the order matters. In a regular
fully connected network, the order of input doesn't really matter.

Another property of  RNNs is that they can handle variable input
and output. Consider again the simplified breast cancer dataset. If you
have trained a regular FCNN on the dataset with the two features, it
makes no sense to suddenly add a third feature. The network would not
know what to do with it, and would reject such inputs with three
features (or any other number of features that isn't two, for that
matter).

!split
===== More whys =====
!bblock
o Traditional feedforward networks process fixed-size inputs and ignore temporal order. RNNs incorporate recurrence to handle sequential data like time series or language ￼.
o At each time step, an RNN cell processes input x_t and a hidden state h_{t-1} from the previous step, producing a new hidden state h_t and (optionally) an output y_t.
o This hidden state acts as a “memory” carrying information forward. For example, predicting stock prices or words in a sentence relies on past inputs ￼ ￼.
o RNNs share parameters across time steps, so they can generalize patterns regardless of sequence length ￼.

!split
===== RNN Forward Pass Equations =====

For a simple (vanilla) RNN with one hidden layer and no bias, the state update and output are:
!bt
\[
\mathbf{h}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_{xh}\mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{W}_{hh}\mathbf{h}_{t-1})\,,\quad \mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{W}_{yh}\mathbf{h}_t,
\]
!et
where $\sigma$ is an activation (e.g. tanh or ReLU) ￼.

In matrix form,
!bt
\[
\mathbf{W}_{xh}\in\mathbb{R}^{h\times d}, \mathbf{W}_{hh}\in\mathbb{R}^{h\times h}, \mathbf{W}_{yh}\in\mathbb{R}^{q\times h},
\]
!et
for input dimension  $d$, hidden dimension $h$, output dimension $q$.

Because the same $\mathbf{W}$ are used each step, gradients during training will propagate through time.

!split
===== Unrolled RNN in Time =====

!bblock
o Input $x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots$ feed sequentially; the hidden state flows from one step to the next, capturing past context.
o After processing the final input $x_T$, the network can make a prediction (many-to-one) or outputs can be produced at each step (many-to-many).
o Unrolling clarifies that training an RNN is like training a deep feedforward network of depth T, with recurrent connections tying layers together.
!eblock

!split
===== Example Task: Character-level RNN Classification =====
!bblock
o A classic example: feed a name (sequence of characters) one char at a time, and classify its language of origin.
o At each step, the RNN outputs a hidden state; we use the final hidden state to predict the class of the entire sequence.
o A character-level RNN reads words as a series of characters—outputting a prediction and ‘hidden state’ at each step, feeding the previous hidden state into the next step. We take the final prediction to be the output” ￼.
o This illustrates sequence-to-one modeling: every output depends on all previous inputs.

===== Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and Gradients =====

!bblock Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
o Training an RNN involves computing gradients through time by unfolding the network: treat the unrolled RNN as a very deep feedforward net.
o We compute the loss $L = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \ell(y_t,\hat y_t)$ and backpropagate from $t=T$ down to $t=1.$
o The computational graphs in the figures below shows how each hidden state depends on inputs and parameters across time ￼.
o BPTT applies the chain rule along this graph, accumulating gradients from each time step into the shared parameters.
!eblock

!split
===== Truncated BPTT and Gradient Clipping =====

!bblock
o Truncated BPTT: Instead of backpropagating through all T steps, we may backpropagate through a fixed window of length $\tau$. This approximates the full gradient and reduces computation.
o Concretely, one computes gradients up to $\tau$ steps and treats gradients beyond as zero. This still allows learning short-term patterns efficiently.
o Gradient Clipping: Cap the gradient norm to a maximum value to prevent explosion. For example in PyTorch: torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0) ensures $\|\nabla\|\le 1$.
o These techniques help stabilize training, but the fundamental vanishing problem motivates using alternative RNN cells (LSTM/GRU) in practice (see below).
!eblock



!split
===== Limitations and Considerations =====
!bblock
o Vanishing Gradients: Simple RNNs have fundamental difficulty learning long-term dependencies due to gradient decay ￼.
o Capacity: Without gates, RNNs may struggle with tasks requiring remembering far-back inputs. Training can be slow as it’s inherently sequential.
o Alternatives: In practice, gated RNNs (LSTM/GRU) or Transformers are often used for long-range dependencies. However, simple RNNs are still instructive and sometimes sufficient for short sequences ￼ ￼.
o Regularization: Weight decay or dropout (on inputs/states) can help generalization but must be applied carefully due to temporal correlations.
o Statefulness: For very long sequences, one can preserve hidden state across batches (stateful RNN) to avoid resetting memory.

===== PyTorch RNN Time Series Example =====

We first implement a simple RNN in PyTorch to forecast a univariate
time series (a sine wave). The steps are: (1) generate synthetic data
and form input/output sequences; (2) define an nn.RNN model; (3) train
the model with MSE loss and an optimizer; (4) evaluate on a held-out
test set. For example, using a sine wave as in prior tutorials ￼, we
create sliding windows of length seq_length. The code below shows each
step. We use nn.RNN (the basic recurrent layer) followed by a linear
output. The training loop (with MSELoss and Adam) updates the model to
minimize prediction error ￼.

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import torch
from torch import nn, optim

# 1. Data preparation: generate a sine wave and create input-output sequences
time_steps = np.linspace(0, 100, 500)
data = np.sin(time_steps)                   # shape (500,)
seq_length = 20
X, y = [], []
for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
    X.append(data[i:i+seq_length])         # sequence of length seq_length
    y.append(data[i+seq_length])           # next value to predict
X = np.array(X)                            # shape (480, seq_length)
y = np.array(y)                            # shape (480,)
# Add feature dimension (1) for the RNN input
X = X[..., None]                           # shape (480, seq_length, 1)
y = y[..., None]                           # shape (480, 1)

# Split into train/test sets (80/20 split)
train_size = int(0.8 * len(X))
X_train = torch.tensor(X[:train_size], dtype=torch.float32)
y_train = torch.tensor(y[:train_size], dtype=torch.float32)
X_test  = torch.tensor(X[train_size:],  dtype=torch.float32)
y_test  = torch.tensor(y[train_size:],  dtype=torch.float32)

# 2. Model definition: simple RNN followed by a linear layer
class SimpleRNNModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=1, hidden_size=16, num_layers=1):
        super(SimpleRNNModel, self).__init__()
        # nn.RNN for sequential data (batch_first=True expects (batch, seq_len, features))
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)    # output layer for prediction

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)                 # out: (batch, seq_len, hidden_size)
        out = out[:, -1, :]                  # take output of last time step
        return self.fc(out)                 # linear layer to 1D output

model = SimpleRNNModel(input_size=1, hidden_size=16, num_layers=1)
print(model)  # print model summary (structure)
!ec

Model Explanation: Here input$\_$size=1 because each time step has one
feature. The RNN hidden state has size 16, and batch$\_$first=True means
input tensors have shape (batch, seq$\_$len, features). We take the last
RNN output and feed it through a linear layer to predict the next
value .

!bc pycod
# 3. Training loop: MSE loss and Adam optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()                  # mean squared error loss
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

epochs = 50
for epoch in range(1, epochs+1):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(X_train)               # forward pass
    loss = criterion(output, y_train)     # compute training loss
    loss.backward()                       # backpropagate
    optimizer.step()                      # update weights
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {epoch}/{epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
!ec

Training Details: We train for 50 epochs, printing the training loss
every 10 epochs. As training proceeds, the loss (MSE) typically
decreases, indicating the RNN is learning the sine-wave pattern ￼.

!bc pycod
# 4. Evaluation on test set
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    pred = model(X_test)
    test_loss = criterion(pred, y_test)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss.item():.4f}')

# (Optional) View a few actual vs. predicted values
print("Actual:", y_test[:5].flatten().numpy())
print("Pred : ", pred[:5].flatten().numpy())
!ec

Evaluation: We switch to eval mode and compute loss on the test
set. The lower test loss indicates how well the model generalizes. The
code prints a few sample predictions against actual values for
qualitative assessment. 

!split
===== Tensorflow (Keras) RNN Time Series Example =====

Next, we use TensorFlow/Keras to do the same task. We build a
tf.keras.Sequential model with a SimpleRNN layer (the most basic
recurrent layer) ￼ followed by a Dense output. The workflow is
similar: create the same synthetic sine data and split it into
train/test sets; then define, train, and evaluate the model.

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# 1. Data preparation: same sine wave data and sequences as above
time_steps = np.linspace(0, 100, 500)
data = np.sin(time_steps)                     # (500,)
seq_length = 20
X, y = [], []
for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
    X.append(data[i:i+seq_length])
    y.append(data[i+seq_length])
X = np.array(X)                               # (480, seq_length)
y = np.array(y)                               # (480,)
# reshape for RNN: (samples, timesteps, features)
X = X.reshape(-1, seq_length, 1)             # (480, 20, 1)
y = y.reshape(-1, 1)                         # (480, 1)

# Split into train/test (80/20)
split = int(0.8 * len(X))
X_train, X_test = X[:split], X[split:]
y_train, y_test = y[:split], y[split:]
!ec

Data: We use the same sine-wave sequence and sliding-window split as
in the PyTorch example ￼. The arrays are reshaped to (batch,
timesteps, features) for Keras.

!bc pycod
# 2. Model definition: Keras SimpleRNN and Dense
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(16, input_shape=(seq_length, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')   # MSE loss and Adam optimizer
model.summary()
!ec

Explanation: Here SimpleRNN(16) creates 16 recurrent units. The model
summary shows the shapes and number of parameters. (Keras handles the
sequence dimension internally.)

!bc pycod
# 3. Training
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=50,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_split=0.2,    # use 20% of train data for validation
    verbose=1
)
!ec


Training: We train for 50 epochs. The fit call also reports validation
loss (using a 20$%$ split of the training data) to monitor
generalization.

!bc pycod
# 4. Evaluation on test set
test_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}')

# (Optional) Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Actual:", y_test.flatten()[:5])
print("Pred : ", predictions.flatten()[:5])
!ec

Evaluation: After training, we call model.evaluate on the test set. A
low test loss indicates good forecasting accuracy. We also predict and
compare a few samples of actual vs. predicted values. This completes
the simple RNN forecasting example in TensorFlow.

Both examples use only basic RNN cells (no LSTM/GRU) and include data
preparation, model definition, training loop, and evaluation. The
PyTorch code uses nn.RNN as and the Keras
code uses SimpleRNN layer. Each code block above is self-contained
and can be run independently with standard libraries (NumPy, PyTorch
or TensorFlow).

!split
===== Gating mechanism: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) =====

Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, as discussed above, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b"
and URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b".


LSTM uses a memory cell for  modeling long-range dependencies and avoid vanishing gradient  problems.
Capable of modeling longer term dependencies by having
memory cells and gates that controls the information flow along
with the memory cells.

o Introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) who solved the problem of getting an RNN to remember things for a long time (like hundreds of time steps).
o They designed a memory cell using logistic and linear units with multiplicative interactions.
o Information gets into the cell whenever its “write” gate is on.
o The information stays in the cell so long as its _keep_ gate is on.
o Information can be read from the cell by turning on its _read_ gate. 

The LSTM were first introduced to overcome the vanishing gradient problem.

!split
===== Implementing a memory cell in a neural network =====

To preserve information for a long time in
the activities of an RNN, we use a circuit
that implements an analog memory cell.

o A linear unit that has a self-link with a weight of 1 will maintain its state.
o Information is stored in the cell by activating its write gate.
o Information is retrieved by activating the read gate.
o We can backpropagate through this circuit because logistics are have nice derivatives. 


!split
===== LSTM details =====

The LSTM is a unit cell that is made of three gates:
o the input gate,
o the forget gate,
o and the output gate.

It also introduces a cell state $c$, which can be thought of as the
long-term memory, and a hidden state $h$ which can be thought of as
the short-term memory.
!split
===== LSTM Cell and Gates =====
!bblock
o Each LSTM cell contains a memory cell $C_t$ and three gates (forget $f_t$, input $i_t$, output $o_t$) that control information flow.
o _Forget gate_ ($f_t$): chooses which information to erase from the previous cell state $C_{t-1}$ 
o _Input gate_ ($i_t$): decides which new information $\tilde{C}_t$ to add to the cell state.
o _Output gate_ ($o_t$): controls which parts of the cell state become the output $h_t$.
o The cell state update: $C_t = f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t$
!eblock

!split
===== Core LSTM Equations =====
!bblock The gate computations and state updates are given by:
!bt
\begin{align*}
    f_t &= \sigma(W_f [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f), \\
    i_t &= \sigma(W_i [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i), \\
    \tilde{C}_t &= \tanh(W_C [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C), \\
    C_t &= f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t, \\
    o_t &= \sigma(W_o [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o), \\
    h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(C_t).
  \end{align*}
!et
!eblock
o $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $\odot$ is elementwise product [oai_citation:4‡jaketae.github.io](https://jaketae.github.io/study/dissecting-lstm/#:~:text=%5C%5B%5Cbegin,align).
o These equations define how LSTM retains/updates memory and produces outputs.

!split
===== Gate Intuition and Dynamics =====
!bblock
o Forget gate $f_t$ acts as a soft “erase” signal: $f_t \approx 0$ forgets, $f_t \approx 1$ retains previous memory.
o Input gate $i_t$ scales how much new candidate memory $\tilde{C}_t$ is written.
o Output gate $o_t$ determines how much of the cell's memory flows into the hidden state $h_t$.
o By controlling these gates, LSTM effectively keeps long-term information when needed.

at (say, time $t$), and the hidden cell state input at $t-1$, passing
it through the Sigmoid activation function and then performing an
element-wise multiplication, denoted by $\odot$.

Mathematically we have (see also figure below)
!bt
\[
\mathbf{f}^{(t)} = \sigma(W_{fx}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{fh}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_f)
\]
!et
where the $W$s are the weights to be trained.

===== The forget gate =====

The naming forget gate stems from the fact that  the Sigmoid activation function's
outputs are very close to $0$ if the argument for the function is very
negative, and $1$ if the argument is very positive. Hence we can
control the amount of information we want to take from the long-term
memory.
!bt
\[
\mathbf{f}^{(t)} = \sigma(W_{fx}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{fh}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_f)
\]
!et
where the $W$s are the weights to be trained.


!split
===== Basic layout =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM7.png, width=700 frac=1.0]

!split
===== Input gate =====

The next stage is the input gate, which consists of both a Sigmoid
function ($\sigma_i$), which decide what percentage of the input will
be stored in the long-term memory, and the $\tanh_i$ function, which
decide what is the full memory that can be stored in the long term
memory. When these results are calculated and multiplied together, it
is added to the cell state or stored in the long-term memory, denoted
as $\oplus$. 

We have
!bt
\[
\mathbf{i}^{(t)} = \sigma_g(W_{ix}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{ih}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_i),
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\mathbf{g}^{(t)} = \tanh(W_{gx}\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + W_{gh}\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_g),
\]
!et
again the $W$s are the weights to train.




!split
===== Short summary  =====

!split
===== Forget and input =====

The forget gate and the input gate together also update the cell state with the following equation, 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{c}^{(t)} = \mathbf{f}^{(t)} \otimes \mathbf{c}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{i}^{(t)} \otimes \mathbf{g}^{(t)},
\]
!et
where $f^{(t)}$ and $i^{(t)}$ are the outputs of the forget gate and the input gate, respectively.


!split
===== Basic layout =====

FIGURE: [figslides/LSTM9.png, width=700 frac=1.0]




!split
===== Output gate =====

The final stage of the LSTM is the output gate, and its purpose is to
update the short-term memory.  To achieve this, we take the newly
generated long-term memory and process it through a hyperbolic tangent
($\tanh$) function creating a potential new short-term memory. We then
multiply this potential memory by the output of the Sigmoid function
($\sigma_o$). This multiplication generates the final output as well
as the input for the next hidden cell ($h^{\langle t \rangle}$) within
the LSTM cell.

We have 
!bt
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{o}^{(t)} &= \sigma_g(W_o\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_o\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_o), \\
\mathbf{h}^{(t)} &= \mathbf{o}^{(t)} \otimes \sigma_h(\mathbf{c}^{(t)}). \\
\end{aligned}
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{W_o,U_o}$ are the weights of the output gate and $\mathbf{b_o}$ is the bias of the output gate.



!split
===== LSTM Implementation (Code Example) =====
o Using high-level libraries (Keras, PyTorch) simplifies LSTM usage.
o define and train a Keras LSTM on a univariate time series:
!bc pycod
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# X_train shape: (samples, timesteps, 1)
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(32, input_shape=(None, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=16)
!ec
The model learns to map sequences to outputs; input sequences can be constructed via sliding windows.


!split
===== Example: Modeling Dynamical Systems =====
!bblock
o LSTMs can learn complex time evolution of physical systems (e.g. Lorenz attractor, fluid dynamics) from data.
o Serve as data-driven surrogates for ODE/PDE solvers (trained on RK4-generated time series).
o For example, an LSTM surrogate accurately forecast 36h lake hydrodynamics (velocity, temperature) with $<6\%$ error.
o Such models dramatically speed up predictions compared to full numerical simulation.
!eblock

!split
===== Example: Biological Sequences =====
!bblock
o Biological sequences (DNA/RNA/proteins) are effectively categorical time series.
o LSTMs capture sequence motifs and long-range dependencies (akin to language models).
o Widely used in genomics and proteomics (e.g., protein function, gene expression).
o They naturally handle variable-length input by processing one element at a time.
!eblock

!split
===== Training Tips and Variants =====
!bblock
o Preprocess time series (normalize features, windowing); handle variable lengths (padding/truncation).
o Experiment with network depth, hidden units, and regularization (dropout) to avoid overfitting.
o Consider bidirectional LSTM or stacking multiple LSTM layers for complex patterns.
o GRU is a simpler gated RNN that combines forget/input gates into one update gate.
o Monitor gradients during training; use gradient clipping to stabilize learning if needed.
!eblock

!split
===== LSTM Summary =====
!bblock
o LSTMs extend RNNs with gated cells to remember long-term context, addressing RNN gradient issues.
o Core update: $C_t = f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t$, output $h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(C_t)$.
o Implementation is straightforward in libraries like Keras/PyTorch with few lines of code.
o Applications span science and engineering: forecasting dynamical systems, analyzing DNA/proteins, etc.
o For more details, see Goodfellow et al. (2016) Deep Learning, chapter 14

===== Summary of LSTM =====

LSTMs provide a basic approach for modeling long-range dependencies in sequences.
If you wish to read more, see _An Empirical Exploration of Recurrent Network Architectures_, authored
by Rafal Jozefowicz *et al.,*  Proceedings of ICML, 2342-2350, 2015).

An important recent development are the so-called _gated recurrent units (GRU)_, see for example the article
by Junyoung Chung *et al.,*, at URL:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555.
This article is an excellent read if you are interested in learning
more about these modern RNN architectures

The GRUs have a simpler
architecture than LSTMs. This leads to computationally more efficient methods, while their
performance in some tasks, such as polyphonic music modeling, is comparable to LSTMs.

Key points:
1. The input images (28x28 pixels) are treated as sequences of 28 timesteps with 28 features each
2. The LSTM layer processes this sequential data
3. A final dense layer with softmax activation handles the classification
4. Typical accuracy ranges between 95-98% (lower than CNNs but reasonable for demonstration)

Note: LSTMs are not typically used for image classification (CNNs are more efficient), but this demonstrates how to adapt them for such tasks. Training might take longer compared to CNN architectures.

To improve performance, you could:
1. Add more LSTM layers
2. Use Bidirectional LSTMs
3. Increase the number of units
4. Add dropout for regularization
5. Use learning rate scheduling

===== Dynamical ordinary differential equation =====

Let us illustrate how we could train an RNN using data from the
solution of a well-known differential equation, namely Newton's
equation for oscillatory motion for an object being forced into
harmonic oscillations by an applied external force.

We will start with the basic algorithm for solving this type of
equations using the Runge-Kutta-4 approach. The first code example is
a standalone differential equation solver. It yields positions and
velocities as function of time, starting with an initial time $t_0$
and ending with a final time.

The data the program produces will in turn be used to train an RNN for
a selected number of training data. With a trained RNN, we will then
use the network to make predictions for data not included in the
training. That is, we will train a model which should be able to
reproduce velocities and positions not included in training data.

===== Using the above data to train an RNN =====


In the code here we have reworked the previous example in order to
generate data that can be handled by recurrent neural networks in
order to train our model. The first code is written using Tensorflow/keras while the second example uses PyTorch.
In both cases we use the Runge Kutta to fourth order as a way to generate the data. We have implemented a simple RNN only.
We leave it as an exercise (possible path in project 3) to implement LSTMs.

===== Autoencoders: Overarching view =====

Autoencoders are artificial neural networks capable of learning
efficient representations of the input data (these representations are called codings)  without
any supervision (i.e., the training set is unlabeled). These codings
typically have a much lower dimensionality than the input data, making
autoencoders useful for dimensionality reduction. 

Autoencoders learn to encode the
input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and then decode it
back to the original data. The goal of autoencoders is to minimize the
reconstruction error, which measures how well the output matches the
input. Autoencoders can be seen as a way of learning the latent
features or hidden structure of the data, and they can be used for
data compression, denoising, anomaly detection, and generative
modeling.

!split
===== Powerful detectors =====

More importantly, autoencoders act as powerful feature detectors, and
they can be used for unsupervised pretraining of deep neural networks.

Lastly, they are capable of randomly generating new data that looks
very similar to the training data; this is called a generative
model. For example, you could train an autoencoder on pictures of
faces, and it would then be able to generate new faces.  Surprisingly,
autoencoders work by simply learning to copy their inputs to their
outputs. This may sound like a trivial task, but we will see that
constraining the network in various ways can make it rather
difficult. For example, you can limit the size of the internal
representation, or you can add noise to the inputs and train the
network to recover the original inputs. These constraints prevent the
autoencoder from trivially copying the inputs directly to the outputs,
which forces it to learn efficient ways of representing the data. In
short, the codings are byproducts of the autoencoder’s attempt to
learn the identity function under some constraints.




!split
===== First introduction of AEs =====

Autoencoders were first introduced by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams
in 1986 with the goal of learning to reconstruct the input
observations with the lowest error possible.


Why would one want to learn to reconstruct the input observations? If
you have problems imagining what that means, think of having a dataset
made of images. An autoencoder would be an algorithm that can give as
output an image that is as similar as possible to the input one. You
may be confused, as there is no apparent reason of doing so. To better
understand why autoencoders are useful we need a more informative
(although not yet unambiguous) definition.

!bblock
An autoencoder is a type of algorithm with the primary purpose of learning an "informative" representation of the data that can be used for different applications ("see Bank, D., Koenigstein, N., and Giryes, R., Autoencoders":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05991") by learning to reconstruct a set of input observations well enough.
!eblock



!split
===== Autoencoder structure =====


Autoencoders are neural networks where the outputs are its own
inputs. They are split into an _encoder part_
which maps the input $\bm{x}$ via a function $f(\bm{x},\bm{W})$ (this
is the encoder part) to a _so-called code part_ (or intermediate part)
with the result $\bm{h}$

!bt
\[
\bm{h} = f(\bm{x},\bm{W})),
\]
!et
where $\bm{W}$ are the weights to be determined.  The _decoder_ parts maps, via its own parameters (weights given by the matrix $\bm{V}$ and its own biases) to 
the final ouput
!bt
\[
\tilde{\bm{x}} = g(\bm{h},\bm{V})).
\]
!et

The goal is to minimize the construction error.

!split
===== Schematic image of an Autoencoder =====

FIGURE: [figures/ae1.png, width=700 frac=1.0]



!split
===== More on the structure =====

In most typical architectures, the encoder and the decoder are neural networks
since they can be easily trained with existing software libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch with back propagation.



In general, the encoder can be written as a function $g$ that will depend on some parameters
!bt
\[
\mathbf{h}_{i} = g(\mathbf{x}_{i}),
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{h}_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{q}$  (the latent feature representation) is the output of the encoder block where we evaluate
it using the input $\mathbf{x}_{i}$.

!split
===== Decoder part =====

Note that we have $g:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{q}$
The decoder and the output of the network $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}$ can be written then as a second generic function
of the latent features
!bt
\[
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i} = f\left(\mathbf{h}_{i}\right) = f\left(g\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right)\right),
\]
!et
where $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}\mathbf{\in }\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

Training an autoencoder simply means finding the functions $g(\cdot)$ and $f(\cdot)$
that satisfy
!bt
\[
\textrm{arg}\min_{f,g}<\left[\Delta (\mathbf{x}_{i}, f(g\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right))\right]>.
\]
!et


!split
===== Typical AEs =====

The standard setup is done via a standard feed forward neural network (FFNN), or what is called a Feed Forward Autoencoder.

A typical FFNN architecture has a given  number of layers and is symmetrical with respect to the middle layer.

Typically, the first layer has a number of neurons $n_{1} = n$ which equals the size of the input observation $\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{i}}$.

As we move toward the center of the network, the number of neurons in each layer drops in some measure.
The middle layer usually has the smallest number of neurons.
The fact that the number of neurons in this layer is smaller than the size of the input, is often called the _bottleneck_.

!split
===== Feed Forward Autoencoder =====

FIGURE: [figures/ae2.pdf, width=700 frac=1.0]


!split
===== Mirroring =====

In almost all practical applications,
the layers after the middle one are a mirrored version of the layers before the middle one.
For example, an autoencoder with three layers could have the following numbers of neurons:

$n_{1} = 10$, $n_{2} = 5$ and then $n_{3} = n_{1} = 10$ where the input dimension is equal to ten.


All the layers up to and including the middle one, make what is called the encoder, and all the layers from and including
the middle one (up to the output) make what is called the decoder.

If the FFNN training is successful, the result will
be a good approximation of the input $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}\approx\mathbf{x}_{i}$.

What is essential to notice is that the decoder can reconstruct the
input by using only a much smaller number of features than the input
observations initially have.

!split
===== Output of middle layer =====

The output of the middle layer
$\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{i}}$ are also called a _learned representation_ of the input observation $\mathbf{x}_{i}$.

The encoder can reduce the number of dimensions of the input
observation and create a learned representation
$\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{i}}\mathbf{) }$ of the input that has a smaller
dimension $q<n$.

This learned representation is enough for the decoder to reconstruct
the input accurately (if the autoencoder training was successful as
intended).

!split
===== Activation Function of the Output Layer =====

In autoencoders based on neural networks, the output layer's
activation function plays a particularly important role.  The most
used functions are ReLU and Sigmoid. 

!split
===== ReLU =====

The  ReLU activation function can assume all values in the range $\left[0,\infty\right]$. As a remainder, its formula is
!bt
\[
\textrm{ReLU}\left(x\right) = \max\left(0,x\right).
\]
!et
This choice is good when the input observations \(\mathbf{x}_{i}\) assume a wide range of positive values.
If the input $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ can assume negative values, the ReLU is, of course, a terrible choice, and the identity function is a much better choice. It is then common to replace to the ReLU with the so-called _Leaky ReLu_ or just modified ReLU.

The ReLU activation function for the output layer is well suited for cases when the input observations \(\mathbf{x}_{i}\) assume a wide range of positive real values.  

!split
===== Sigmoid =====

The sigmoid function $\sigma$ can assume all values in the range $[0,1]$,
!bt
\[
\sigma\left(x\right) =\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}.
\]
!et


This activation function can only be used if the input observations
$\mathbf{x}_{i}$ are all in the range $[0,1]$  or if you have
normalized them to be in that range. Consider as an example the MNIST
dataset. Each value of the input observation $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ (one
image) is the gray values of the pixels that can assume any value from
0 to 255. Normalizing the data by dividing the pixel values by 255
would make each observation (each image) have only pixel values
between 0 and 1. In this case, the sigmoid would be a good choice for
the output layer's activation function.

!split
===== Cost/Loss Function =====

If an autoencoder is trying to solve a regression problem, the most
common choice as a loss function is the Mean Square Error

!bt
\[
L_{\textrm{MSE}} = \textrm{MSE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left\vert\vert\mathbf{x}_{i}-\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}\right\vert\vert^{2}_2.
\]
!et


!split
===== Binary Cross-Entropy =====

If the activation function of the output layer of the AE is a sigmoid
function, thus limiting neuron outputs to be between 0 and 1, and the
input features are normalized to be between 0 and 1 we can use as loss
function the binary cross-entropy. This cots/loss function is
typically used in classification problems, but it works well for
autoencoders. The formula for it is

!bt
\[
L_{\textrm{CE}} = -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\sum_{j = 1}^{p}[x_{j,i} \log\tilde{x}_{j,i}+\left(1-x_{j,i}\right)\log (1-\tilde{x}_{j,i})].
\]
!et

!split
===== Reconstruction Error =====

The reconstruction error (RE) is a metric that gives you an indication of how good (or bad) the autoencoder was able to reconstruct
the input observation $\mathbf{x}_{i}$. The most typical RE used is the MSE

!bt
\[
\textrm{RE}\equiv \textrm{MSE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left\vert\vert\mathbf{x}_{i}-\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}\right\vert\vert^{2}_2.
\]
!et

!split
===== Implementation using TensorFlow =====

The code here has the following structure
o Data Loading: The MNIST dataset is loaded and normalized to a range of $[0, 1]$. Each image is reshaped into a flat vector.
o Model Definition: An autoencoder architecture is defined with an encoder that compresses the input and a decoder that reconstructs it back to its original form.
o Training: The model is trained using binary crossentropy as the loss function over several epochs.
o Visualization: After training completes, it visualizes original images alongside their reconstructions.

===== Dimensionality reduction and links with Principal component analysis =====

The hope is that the training of the autoencoder can unravel some
useful properties of the function $f$. They are often trained with
only single-layer neural networks (although deep networks can improve
the training) and are essentially given by feed forward neural
networks.

!split
===== Linear functions =====

If the function $f$ and $g$ are given by a linear dependence on the
weight matrices $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{V}$, we can show that for a
regression case, by miminizing the mean squared error between $\bm{x}$
and $\tilde{\bm{x}}$, the autoencoder learns the same subspace as the
standard principal component analysis (PCA).

In order to see this, we define then
!bt
\[
\bm{h} = f(\bm{x},\bm{W}))=\bm{W}\bm{x},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\tilde{\bm{x}} = g(\bm{h},\bm{V}))=\bm{V}\bm{h}=\bm{V}\bm{W}\bm{x}.
\]
!et

!split
===== AE mean-squared error =====

With the above linear dependence we can in turn define our
optimization problem in terms of the optimization of the mean-squared
error, that is we wish to optimize

!bt
\[
\min_{\bm{W},\bm{V}\in {\mathbb{R}}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(x_i-\tilde{x}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{x}-\bm{V}\bm{W}\bm{x}\vert\vert_2^2,
\]
!et
where we have used the definition of  a norm-2 vector, that is
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2}. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Dimensionality reduction =====

This is equivalent to our functions learning the same subspace as
the PCA method. This means that we can interpret AEs as a
dimensionality reduction method.  To see this, we need to remind
ourselves about the PCA method. This will be the topic of the last lecture, on Monday November 24. We will use this lecture (second lecture) to summarize the course as well. Stay tuned.

===== Why Recurrent Networks? =====
!bblock
o Traditional feedforward networks process fixed-size inputs and ignore temporal order. RNNs incorporate recurrence to handle sequential data like time series or language ￼.
o At each time step, an RNN cell processes input x_t and a hidden state h_{t-1} from the previous step, producing a new hidden state h_t and (optionally) an output y_t.
o This hidden state acts as a “memory” carrying information forward. For example, predicting stock prices or words in a sentence relies on past inputs ￼ ￼.
o RNNs share parameters across time steps, so they can generalize patterns regardless of sequence length ￼.
!eblock

!split
===== RNN Forward Pass Equations =====

For a simple (vanilla) RNN with one hidden layer and no bias, the state update and output are:
!bt
\[
\mathbf{h}_t = \phi(\mathbf{W}_{xh}\mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{W}_{hh}\mathbf{h}_{t-1})\,,\quad \mathbf{y}_t = \mathbf{W}_{yh}\mathbf{h}_t,
\]
!et
where \phi is a nonlinear activation (e.g. tanh or ReLU) ￼.

In matrix form,
!bt
\[
\mathbf{W}_{xh}\in\mathbb{R}^{h\times d}, \mathbf{W}_{hh}\in\mathbb{R}^{h\times h}, \mathbf{W}_{yh}\in\mathbb{R}^{q\times h},
\]
!et
for input dim d, hidden dim h, output dim q.

We often also write
!bt
\[
y_t = f(\mathbf{o}_t) with \mathbf{o}_t=W_{yh}h_t
\]
!et
to include a final activation for classification.

Because the same $\mathbf{W}$ are used each step, gradients during training will propagate through time.

!bt
\[
===== Unrolled RNN in Time =====

!bblock
o Input $x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots$ feed sequentially; the hidden state flows from one step to the next, capturing past context.
o After processing the final input $x_T$, the network can make a prediction (many-to-one) or outputs can be produced at each step (many-to-many).
o Unrolling clarifies that training an RNN is like training a deep feedforward network of depth T, with recurrent connections tying layers together.
!eblock

!split
===== Example Task: Character-level RNN Classification =====
!bblock
o A classic example: feed a name (sequence of characters) one char at a time, and classify its language of origin.
o At each step, the RNN outputs a hidden state; we use the final hidden state to predict the class of the entire sequence.
o A character-level RNN reads words as a series of characters—outputting a prediction and ‘hidden state’ at each step, feeding the previous hidden state into the next step. We take the final prediction to be the output” ￼.
o This illustrates sequence-to-one modeling: every output depends on all previous inputs.

===== Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and Gradients =====

!bblock Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
o Training an RNN involves computing gradients through time by unfolding the network: treat the unrolled RNN as a very deep feedforward net.
o We compute the loss $L = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \ell(y_t,\hat y_t)$ and backpropagate from $t=T$ down to $t=1.$
o The computational graphs in the figures below shows how each hidden state depends on inputs and parameters across time ￼.
o BPTT applies the chain rule along this graph, accumulating gradients from each time step into the shared parameters.
!eblock

!split
===== Truncated BPTT and Gradient Clipping =====

!bblock
o Truncated BPTT: Instead of backpropagating through all T steps, we may backpropagate through a fixed window of length $\tau$. This approximates the full gradient and reduces computation.
o Concretely, one computes gradients up to $\tau$ steps and treats gradients beyond as zero. This still allows learning short-term patterns efficiently.
o Gradient Clipping: Cap the gradient norm to a maximum value to prevent explosion. For example in PyTorch:
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0) ensures $\|\nabla\|\le 1$.
o These techniques help stabilize training, but the fundamental vanishing problem motivates using alternative RNN cells (LSTM/GRU) in practice (see below).
!eblock

!split
===== Applications of Simple RNNs =====

!bblock
o Forecasting: RNNs can predict future values from historical data. Example tasks include stock prices, weather patterns, or any temporal signal ￼.
o By feeding in sequence $\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_T\}$, an RNN can output a prediction $y_T$ (one-step ahead) or even a full sequence $\{y_2,\dots,y_{T+1}\}$.
o Unlike linear models, RNNs can capture complex temporal patterns (trends, seasonality, autocorrelation) in a data-driven way ￼.
o Preprocessing (normalization, sliding windows) is important. Split data into train/test by time (no shuffling).
!eblock

!split
===== Sequence Modeling Tasks =====
!bblock
o Many-to-One: Classify or predict one value from an entire sequence (e.g., sentiment analysis of a movie review, or classifying a time series). We use the final hidden state as a summary of the sequence.
o Many-to-Many (Prediction): Predict an output at each time step (e.g., language modeling or sequential regression). RNN outputs are used at each step.
o Encoder–Decoder (Seq2Seq): (Advanced) Map input sequences to output sequences of different lengths. Though typically LSTM-based, it is s conceptually possible with simple RNNs.
o RNNs also apply to physics and biology: e.g., modeling dynamical systems, protein sequences, or neuroscience time series. Any domain with sequential data can use RNN-based modeling.
!eblock

!split
===== Other Sequence Applications =====
!bblock 
o Sequence Classification: Use RNN hidden state for class labels. For example, classify a time series into anomaly vs normal.
o Sequence Labeling: Predict labels at each time step (e.g. part-of-speech tagging). The RNN outputs a vector at each step passed through a classification layer.
o Language and Text: (Advanced) Character or word-level models use RNNs to generate text or classify documents. E.g., predicting next character from previous ones (RNN language model) ￼.
o Physically Motivated Data: RNNs can model dynamical systems (e.g., rolling ball trajectories, neuron spikes over time, climate data). They learn temporal patterns directly from data without explicit equations.
!eblock

!split
===== Training and Practical Tips =====
!bblock 
o Loss Functions: Use MSE for regression tasks, cross-entropy for classification tasks. Sum or average losses over time steps as needed.
o Batching Sequences: Handle variable-length sequences by padding or using masking. PyTorch pack_padded_sequence or Keras masking can help.
o Optimization: Standard optimizers (SGD, Adam) work. Learning rate may need tuning due to sequential correlations.
o Initial Hidden State: Usually initialized to zeros. Can also learn an initial state or carry hidden state across batches for very long sequences (stateful=True in Keras).
o Regularization: Dropout can be applied to inputs or recurrent states (PyTorch/RNN has dropout option; Keras has dropout/recurrent_dropout).
!eblock

!split
===== Limitations and Considerations =====
!bblock
o Vanishing Gradients: Simple RNNs have fundamental difficulty learning long-term dependencies due to gradient decay ￼.
o Capacity: Without gates, RNNs may struggle with tasks requiring remembering far-back inputs. Training can be slow as it’s inherently sequential.
o Alternatives: In practice, gated RNNs (LSTM/GRU) or Transformers are often used for long-range dependencies. However, simple RNNs are still instructive and sometimes sufficient for short sequences ￼ ￼.
o Regularization: Weight decay or dropout (on inputs/states) can help generalization but must be applied carefully due to temporal correlations.
o Statefulness: For very long sequences, one can preserve hidden state across batches (stateful RNN) to avoid resetting memory.

===== PyTorch RNN Time Series Example =====

We first implement a simple RNN in PyTorch to forecast a univariate
time series (a sine wave). The steps are: (1) generate synthetic data
and form input/output sequences; (2) define an nn.RNN model; (3) train
the model with MSE loss and an optimizer; (4) evaluate on a held-out
test set. For example, using a sine wave as in prior tutorials ￼, we
create sliding windows of length seq_length. The code below shows each
step. We use nn.RNN (the basic recurrent layer) followed by a linear
output. The training loop (with MSELoss and Adam) updates the model to
minimize prediction error ￼.

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import torch
from torch import nn, optim

# 1. Data preparation: generate a sine wave and create input-output sequences
time_steps = np.linspace(0, 100, 500)
data = np.sin(time_steps)                   # shape (500,)
seq_length = 20
X, y = [], []
for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
    X.append(data[i:i+seq_length])         # sequence of length seq_length
    y.append(data[i+seq_length])           # next value to predict
X = np.array(X)                            # shape (480, seq_length)
y = np.array(y)                            # shape (480,)
# Add feature dimension (1) for the RNN input
X = X[..., None]                           # shape (480, seq_length, 1)
y = y[..., None]                           # shape (480, 1)

# Split into train/test sets (80/20 split)
train_size = int(0.8 * len(X))
X_train = torch.tensor(X[:train_size], dtype=torch.float32)
y_train = torch.tensor(y[:train_size], dtype=torch.float32)
X_test  = torch.tensor(X[train_size:],  dtype=torch.float32)
y_test  = torch.tensor(y[train_size:],  dtype=torch.float32)

# 2. Model definition: simple RNN followed by a linear layer
class SimpleRNNModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=1, hidden_size=16, num_layers=1):
        super(SimpleRNNModel, self).__init__()
        # nn.RNN for sequential data (batch_first=True expects (batch, seq_len, features))
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)    # output layer for prediction

    def forward(self, x):
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)                 # out: (batch, seq_len, hidden_size)
        out = out[:, -1, :]                  # take output of last time step
        return self.fc(out)                 # linear layer to 1D output

model = SimpleRNNModel(input_size=1, hidden_size=16, num_layers=1)
print(model)  # print model summary (structure)
!ec

Model Explanation: Here input$\_$size=1 because each time step has one
feature. The RNN hidden state has size 16, and batch$\_$first=True means
input tensors have shape (batch, seq$\_$len, features). We take the last
RNN output and feed it through a linear layer to predict the next
value .

!bc pycod
# 3. Training loop: MSE loss and Adam optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()                  # mean squared error loss
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

epochs = 50
for epoch in range(1, epochs+1):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(X_train)               # forward pass
    loss = criterion(output, y_train)     # compute training loss
    loss.backward()                       # backpropagate
    optimizer.step()                      # update weights
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {epoch}/{epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
!ec

Training Details: We train for 50 epochs, printing the training loss
every 10 epochs. As training proceeds, the loss (MSE) typically
decreases, indicating the RNN is learning the sine-wave pattern ￼.

!bc pycod
# 4. Evaluation on test set
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    pred = model(X_test)
    test_loss = criterion(pred, y_test)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss.item():.4f}')

# (Optional) View a few actual vs. predicted values
print("Actual:", y_test[:5].flatten().numpy())
print("Pred : ", pred[:5].flatten().numpy())
!ec

Evaluation: We switch to eval mode and compute loss on the test
set. The lower test loss indicates how well the model generalizes. The
code prints a few sample predictions against actual values for
qualitative assessment. 

!split
===== Tensorflow (Keras) RNN Time Series Example =====

Next, we use TensorFlow/Keras to do the same task. We build a
tf.keras.Sequential model with a SimpleRNN layer (the most basic
recurrent layer) ￼ followed by a Dense output. The workflow is
similar: create the same synthetic sine data and split it into
train/test sets; then define, train, and evaluate the model.

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# 1. Data preparation: same sine wave data and sequences as above
time_steps = np.linspace(0, 100, 500)
data = np.sin(time_steps)                     # (500,)
seq_length = 20
X, y = [], []
for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
    X.append(data[i:i+seq_length])
    y.append(data[i+seq_length])
X = np.array(X)                               # (480, seq_length)
y = np.array(y)                               # (480,)
# reshape for RNN: (samples, timesteps, features)
X = X.reshape(-1, seq_length, 1)             # (480, 20, 1)
y = y.reshape(-1, 1)                         # (480, 1)

# Split into train/test (80/20)
split = int(0.8 * len(X))
X_train, X_test = X[:split], X[split:]
y_train, y_test = y[:split], y[split:]
!ec

Data: We use the same sine-wave sequence and sliding-window split as
in the PyTorch example ￼. The arrays are reshaped to (batch,
timesteps, features) for Keras.

!bc pycod
# 2. Model definition: Keras SimpleRNN and Dense
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(16, input_shape=(seq_length, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')   # MSE loss and Adam optimizer
model.summary()
!ec

Explanation: Here SimpleRNN(16) creates 16 recurrent units. The model
summary shows the shapes and number of parameters. (Keras handles the
sequence dimension internally.)

!bc pycod
# 3. Training
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=50,
    batch_size=32,
    validation_split=0.2,    # use 20% of train data for validation
    verbose=1
)
!ec


Training: We train for 50 epochs. The fit call also reports validation
loss (using a 20$%$ split of the training data) to monitor
generalization.

!bc pycod
# 4. Evaluation on test set
test_loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}')

# (Optional) Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Actual:", y_test.flatten()[:5])
print("Pred : ", predictions.flatten()[:5])
!ec

Evaluation: After training, we call model.evaluate on the test set. A
low test loss indicates good forecasting accuracy. We also predict and
compare a few samples of actual vs. predicted values. This completes
the simple RNN forecasting example in TensorFlow.

Both examples use only basic RNN cells (no LSTM/GRU) and include data
preparation, model definition, training loop, and evaluation. The
PyTorch code uses nn.RNN as and the Keras
code uses SimpleRNN layer. Each code block above is self-contained
and can be run independently with standard libraries (NumPy, PyTorch
or TensorFlow).

\begin{frame}{What is an Autoencoder?}
\begin{itemize}
\item An autoencoder (AE) is a neural network trained to reconstruct its input: $\hat{x}=\mathrm{Dec}(\mathrm{Enc}(x))$.
\item Components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Encoder} $f_\theta:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^m$ compresses input to latent code $z=f_\theta(x)$
\item \textbf{Decoder} $g_\phi:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^d$ reconstructs $\hat{x}=g_\phi(z)$
\end{itemize}
\item Training objective: minimize reconstruction loss, e.g. MSE
\mathcal{L}(\theta,\phi)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \|x^{(i)}-g_\phi(f_\theta(x^{(i)}))\|^2_2.

\begin{itemize}
\item Encoder + Decoder may be \emph{linear} or \emph{nonlinear}.
\item Bottleneck dimension $m$ controls compression; if $m<d$ we force representation learning.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Linear Autoencoder}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider linear encoder and decoder with no biases for simplicity:
z=W_e x,\qquad \hat{x}=W_d z = W_d W_e x.
\item Minimize reconstruction error over dataset $X\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times N}$ (columns are datapoints):
\min_{W_e,W_d} \|X - W_d W_e X\|_F^2.
\item Let $W= W_d W_e$ be a rank-$m$ matrix approximation of the identity mapping on the data subspace.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Linear AE \leftrightarrow PCA}
\begin{itemize}
\item If we constrain $W_e$ to have orthonormal rows and $W_d=W_e^T$, minimizing Frobenius norm leads to PCA projection onto top-$m$ principal components.
\item Proof sketch (informal): SVD of data $X = U \Sigma V^T$. Best rank-$m$ approximation in Frobenius norm is via truncation $U_m\Sigma_m V_m^T$ (Eckart–Young theorem). Linear AE learns the same subspace when optimal.
\item Therefore linear AE with MSE and appropriate constraints recovers PCA.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Derivation (Sketch)}
\begin{align*}
&\min_{W,:,\mathrm{rank}(W)\le m} |X - W X|_F^2 \[2mm]
&\text{SVD: } X = U \Sigma V^T, \quad X_m = U_m \Sigma_m V_m^T \\
&\Rightarrow \operatorname{argmin}_W \|X - W X\|F^2 = P{U_m} = U_m U_m^T,
\end{align*}
which is the projection onto the leading $m$ principal components. A linear AE with encoder $W_e=U_m^T$, decoder $W_d=U_m$ achieves this.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Practical remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear AE = good for understanding; nonlinear AE (with activations) can learn more complex manifolds.
\item Bottleneck dimension $m$ should balance reconstruction fidelity vs. compression.
\item Regularization (weight decay, sparsity) helps to learn meaningful features.

\begin{frame}{Discussion: Architectures and Choices}
\begin{itemize}
\item Activation functions: ReLU often for hidden layers, sigmoid for output when input scaled to [0,1].
\item Loss: MSE for continuous-valued inputs; binary cross-entropy if inputs are binary/normalized.
\item Bottleneck/latent size affects compression and reconstruction quality.
\item Use dropout, batch-norm, or weight decay as needed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Lecture 3: Denoising, Sparse, and Regularized Autoencoders}

\begin{frame}{Learning Goals (Lecture 3)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand denoising and sparse autoencoders.
\item Learn regularization techniques to improve latent representations.
\item See code examples for denoising and sparse penalties.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Idea: Corrupt input $x$ with noise to $\tilde{x}$ and train AE to reconstruct the clean $x$.
\item Objective: $\mathbb{E}{x\sim p{data}}\mathbb{E}{\tilde{x}\sim q(\tilde{x}|x)}\big[\ell(x,g\phi(f_\theta(\tilde{x})))\big]$.
\item Denoising forces encoder to learn robust features and manifold structure.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{PyTorch: Denoising Autoencoder (Snippet)}
\begin{lstlisting}

Add Gaussian noise to inputs and train AE to reconstruct clean images

noise_std = 0.3
for xb, _ in train_loader:
xb_noisy = xb + noise_std * torch.randn_like(xb)
xb_noisy = torch.clip(xb_noisy, 0., 1.)
optimizer.zero_grad()
xhat = model(xb_noisy)
loss = criterion(xhat, xb)  # target is original clean xb
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sparse Autoencoders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Encourage activations in the latent code to be sparse (many near-zero).
\item Add penalty (e.g., $L_1$ on activations, or KL divergence to small target sparsity $\rho$):
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i \|x^{(i)}-\hat{x}^{(i)}\|^2 + \beta \sum_j \text{KL}(\rho \| \hat{\rho}_j),
where $\hat{\rho}_j$ is average activation of unit $j$ across data.
\item Sparsity encourages disentanglement and interpretable features.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Implementation: Sparsity via $L_1$ Penalty (PyTorch)}
\begin{lstlisting}

After forward pass: z = model.encoder(xb)

l1_lambda = 1e-5
reconstruction = model.decoder(z)
mse = criterion(reconstruction, xb)
l1_penalty = l1_lambda * torch.mean(torch.abs(z))
loss = mse + l1_penalty
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Contractive Autoencoders (Brief)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Penalize sensitivity of encoder to input by adding Frobenius norm of Jacobian $J_{f}(x)$:
\mathcal{L} = \text{recon loss} + \lambda \|J_f(x)\|_F^2.
\item Encourages robustness and local invariance around training points.
\item More expensive: requires computing Jacobian or tractable approximations.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Applications: Denoising, Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Denoising}: reconstruct clean signals from noisy inputs (images, sensor data).
\item \textbf{Dimensionality reduction}: use latent $z$ for visualization, clustering.
\item \textbf{Anomaly detection}: large reconstruction error indicates outliers or anomalies.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Lecture 4: Applications, Evaluation & Advanced Tips}

\begin{frame}{Learning Goals (Lecture 4)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Put together applications: anomaly detection pipeline, denoising in practice.
\item Discuss evaluation metrics and practical tips (regularization, early stopping, hyperparameters).
\item Provide complete runnable examples in PyTorch and TensorFlow that illustrate anomaly detection and denoising.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Train AE on “normal” data only.
\item For a test point $x^$ compute reconstruction error $r(x^)=|x^-\hat{x}^|^2$.
\item If $r(x^*)$ exceeds threshold $\tau$, flag as anomaly. Threshold chosen via validation set or percentile.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{PyTorch: Anomaly Detection Example (Synthetic)}
\begin{lstlisting}

Train AE on normal sine-wave data (from earlier lecture). After training:

with torch.no_grad():
recon = model(X_test)
errors = torch.mean((recon - X_test)**2, dim=(1,2))  # per-sample MSE

Choose threshold (e.g., 95th percentile of train errors)

with torch.no_grad():
recon_train = model(X_train)
train_errors = torch.mean((recon_train - X_train)**2, dim=(1,2))
threshold = torch.quantile(train_errors, 0.95)
anomalies = (errors > threshold)
print(‘Detected’, anomalies.sum().item(), ‘anomalies out of’, len(errors))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{TensorFlow: Denoising AE Example (MNIST) — Code}
\begin{lstlisting}

Using autoencoder defined earlier (TensorFlow)

import numpy as np
noise_factor = 0.5
x_train_noisy = x_train + noise_factor * np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=x_train.shape)
x_train_noisy = np.clip(x_train_noisy, 0., 1.)
autoencoder.fit(x_train_noisy, x_train, epochs=10, batch_size=128, validation_split=0.1)

Then predict on noisy test images

x_test_noisy = x_test + noise_factor * np.random.normal(size=x_test.shape)
x_test_noisy = np.clip(x_test_noisy, 0., 1.)
reconstructions = autoencoder.predict(x_test_noisy)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Evaluation Metrics and Model Selection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reconstruction MSE / MAE: direct measure of reconstruction quality.
\item For anomaly detection: Precision/Recall, ROC-AUC using reconstruction error as score.
\item Visualization: t-SNE or PCA of latent vectors $z$ to inspect cluster structure.
\item Cross-validation / held-out validation using normal data only for threshold selection.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Practical Tips}
\begin{itemize}
\item Normalize inputs consistently (e.g., [0,1] or zero-mean unit-variance).
\item Small learning rates and early stopping help prevent overfitting to noise.
\item Monitor validation reconstruction and latent-space structure.
\item Consider deeper architectures or convolutional autoencoders for images.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Extensions (Brief Overview)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): probabilistic latent models (not covered here in detail).
\item Convolutional and Sequence Autoencoders: replace dense layers with conv / RNN layers for images or sequences.
\item Generative modeling, representation learning, and semi-supervised learning applications.
\end{itemize}

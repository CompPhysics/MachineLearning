===== Ridge and LASSO Regression, reminder =====

The expression for the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) which we used to define our cost function and the equations for the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, that is 
our optimization problem is
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
or we can state it as
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2,
\]
!et
where we have used the definition of  a norm-2 vector, that is
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2}. 
\]
!et

By minimizing the above equation with respect to the parameters
$\bm{\beta}$ we could then obtain an analytical expression for the
parameters $\bm{\beta}$.  We can add a regularization parameter $\lambda$ by
defining a new cost function to be optimized, that is

!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2
\]
!et

which leads to the Ridge regression minimization problem where we
require that $\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2\le t$, where $t$ is
a finite number larger than zero. By defining

!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\beta})=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_1,
\]
!et

we have a new optimization equation
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_1
\]
!et
which leads to Lasso regression. Lasso stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. 

Here we have defined the norm-1 as 
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_1 = \sum_i \vert x_i\vert. 
\]
!et

===== Various steps in cross-validation =====

When the repetitive splitting of the data set is done randomly,
samples may accidently end up in a fast majority of the splits in
either training or test set. Such samples may have an unbalanced
influence on either model building or prediction evaluation. To avoid
this $k$-fold cross-validation structures the data splitting. The
samples are divided into $k$ more or less equally sized exhaustive and
mutually exclusive subsets. In turn (at each split) one of these
subsets plays the role of the test set while the union of the
remaining subsets constitutes the training set. Such a splitting
warrants a balanced representation of each sample in both training and
test set over the splits. Still the division into the $k$ subsets
involves a degree of randomness. This may be fully excluded when
choosing $k=n$. This particular case is referred to as leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV). 

!split 
===== How to set up the cross-validation for Ridge and/or Lasso =====

* Define a range of interest for the penalty parameter.

* Divide the data set into training and test set comprising samples $\{1, \ldots, n\} \setminus i$ and $\{ i \}$, respectively.

* Fit the linear regression model by means of ridge estimation  for each $\lambda$ in the grid using the training set, and the corresponding estimate of the error variance $\bm{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)$, as
!bt
\begin{align*}
\bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda) & =  ( \bm{X}_{-i, \ast}^{T}
\bm{X}_{-i, \ast} + \lambda \bm{I}_{pp})^{-1}
\bm{X}_{-i, \ast}^{T} \bm{y}_{-i}
\end{align*}
!et 

* Evaluate the prediction performance of these models on the test set by $\log\{L[y_i, \bm{X}_{i, \ast}; \bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda), \bm{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)]\}$. Or, by the prediction error $|y_i - \bm{X}_{i, \ast} \bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda)|$, the relative error, the error squared or the R2 score function.

* Repeat the first three steps  such that each sample plays the role of the test set once.

* Average the prediction performances of the test sets at each grid point of the penalty bias/parameter. It is an estimate of the prediction performance of the model corresponding to this value of the penalty parameter on novel data. It is defined as
!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \log\{L[y_i, \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast}; \bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda), \bm{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)]\}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Cross-validation in brief =====

For the various values of $k$

o shuffle the dataset randomly.
o Split the dataset into $k$ groups.
o For each unique group:
 o Decide which group to use as set for test data
 o Take the remaining groups as a training data set
 o Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
 o Retain the evaluation score and discard the model
o Summarize the model using the sample of model evaluation scores

===== To think about, first part =====

When you are comparing your own code with for example _Scikit-Learn_'s
library, there are some things to keep in mind.  The examples
here demonstrate some of these aspects with potential pitfalls.

The discussion here focuses on the role of the intercept, how we can
set up the design matrix, what scaling we should use and other topics
which may confuse us.



The intercept can be interpreted as the expected value of our
target/output variables when all other predictors are set to zero.
Thus, if we cannot assume that the expected outputs/targets are zero
when all predictors are zero (the columns in the design matrix), it
may be a bad idea to implement a model which penalizes the intercept.
Furthermore, in for example Ridge and Lasso regression, the solutions
(when not shrinking $\beta_0$) for the unknown parameters
$\bm{\beta}$ are derived under the assumption that both $\bm{y}$ and
$\bm{X}$ are zero centered, that is we subtract the mean values.


!split
=====  More thinking =====


If our predictors represent different scales, then it is important to
standardize the design matrix $\bm{X}$ by subtracting the mean of each
column from the corresponding column and dividing the column with its
standard deviation. Most machine learning libraries do this as a deafult. This means that if you compare your code with the results from a given library,
the results may differ. Tracing back the differences may often lead to an increased confusion.

The
"Standadscaler":"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html"
function in _Scikit-Learn_ does this for us.  For the data sets we
have been studying in our various examples, the data are in many cases
already scaled and there is no need to scale them. You as a user of different machine learning algorithms, should always perform  a
survey of your data, with a critical assessment of them in case you need to scale the data.

If you need to scale the data, not doing so will give an *unfair*
penalization of the parameters since their magnitude depends on the
scale of their corresponding predictor.

Suppose as an example that you 
you have an input variable given by the heights of different persons.
Human height might be measured in inches or meters or
kilometers. If measured in kilometers, a standard linear regression
model with this predictor would probably give a much bigger
coefficient term, than if measured in millimeters.
This can clearly lead to problems in evaluating the cost/loss functions.


!split
===== Still thinking =====

Keep in mind that when you transform your data set before training a model, the same transformation needs to be done
on your eventual new data set  before making a prediction. If we translate this into a Python code, it would could be implemented as follows

!bc pycod
#Model training, we compute the mean value of y and X
y_train_mean = np.mean(y_train)
X_train_mean = np.mean(X_train,axis=0)
X_train = X_train - X_train_mean
y_train = y_train - y_train_mean

# The we fit our model with the training data
trained_model = some_model.fit(X_train,y_train)


#Model prediction, here we need also to transform our data set used for the prediction.
X_test = X_test - X_train_mean #Use mean from training data
y_pred = trained_model(X_test)
y_pred = y_pred + y_train_mean
!ec

!split
=====  Linear Regression code, Intercept handling first =====

This code shows a simple first-order fit to a data set using the above transformed data, where we consider the role of the intercept first, by either excluding it or including it (*code example thanks to  Øyvind Sigmundson Schøyen*). Here our scaling of the data is done by subtracting the mean values only.

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression


np.random.seed(2021)


def fit_beta(X, y):
    return np.linalg.pinv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ y


true_beta = [2, 0.5, 3.7]

x = np.linspace(0, 1, 11)
y = np.sum(
    np.asarray([x ** p * b for p, b in enumerate(true_beta)]), axis=0
) + 0.1 * np.random.normal(size=len(x))

degree = 3
X = np.zeros((len(x), degree))

# Include the intercept in the design matrix
for p in range(degree):
    X[:, p] = x ** p

beta = fit_beta(X, y)

# Intercept is included in the design matrix
clf = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False).fit(X, y)

print(f"True beta: {true_beta}")
print(f"Fitted beta: {beta}")
print(f"Sklearn fitted beta: {clf.coef_}")


plt.figure()
plt.scatter(x, y, label="Data")
plt.plot(x, X @ beta, label="Fit")
plt.plot(x, clf.predict(X), label="Sklearn (fit_intercept=False)")


# Do not include the intercept in the design matrix
X = np.zeros((len(x), degree - 1))

for p in range(degree - 1):
    X[:, p] = x ** (p + 1)

# Intercept is not included in the design matrix
clf = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True).fit(X, y)

# Use centered values for X and y when computing coefficients
y_offset = np.average(y, axis=0)
X_offset = np.average(X, axis=0)

beta = fit_beta(X - X_offset, y - y_offset)
intercept = np.mean(y_offset - X_offset @ beta)

print(f"Manual intercept: {intercept}")
print(f"Fitted beta (sans intercept): {beta}")
print(f"Sklearn intercept: {clf.intercept_}")
print(f"Sklearn fitted beta (sans intercept): {clf.coef_}")

===== What does centering (subtracting the mean values) mean mathematically? =====


Let us try to understand what this may imply mathematically when we subtract the mean values, also known as *zero centering*. To catch many birds with just one stone, we will focus on Ridge regression.

The cost/loss function  for Ridge regression is
!bt
\[
C(\beta_0, \beta_1, ... , \beta_{p-1}) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \left(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} X_{ij}\beta_j\right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} \beta_i^2.
\]
!et

Note that the intercept term $\beta_0$is left out of the $L_2$ regularization term. The design matrix
$X$ does in this case not contain any intercept column. We want

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \beta_j} = 0,
\]
!et

for all $j$, so let us start with $\beta_0$. This means that we have

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \beta_0} = -2\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} X_{ij} \beta_j\right),
\]
!et

which gives
!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \beta_0 = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y_i - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} X_{ij} \beta_j.
\]
!et

If we assume that every column of $\bm{X}$ is centered, which we can do by subtracting the mean,
!bc pycod
X = X - np.mean(X,axis=0)
!ec
the sum $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_{ij}$
can be rewritten as
!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(X_{ij} - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_{ij}\right) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_{ij} - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}X_{ij},
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_{ij} - n \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}X_{ij} = 0.
\]
!et


Finally we have
!bt
\[
n\beta_0 = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} y_i - \sum_{j=1}^{p-1}\beta_j \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_{ij},
\]
!et
or
!bt
\[
\beta_0 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} y_i = \overline{\bm{y}},
\]
!et
the average value of $\bm{y}$.

Replacing $y_i$ with $y_i - \beta_0 = y_i - \overline{\bm{y}}$ in the cost function will give us (in vector-matrix disguise)
!bt
\[
C(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = (\boldsymbol{\tilde{y}} - \tilde{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})^T(\boldsymbol{\tilde{y}} - \tilde{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}) + \lambda \boldsymbol{\beta}^T\boldsymbol{\beta},
\]
!et

which has the solution

$\beta = (\tilde{X}^T\tilde{X} + \lambda I)^{-1}\tilde{X}^T\boldsymbol{\tilde{y}}$.
where $\boldsymbol{\tilde{y}} = \boldsymbol{y} - \overline{\bm{y}}$
and $\tilde{X}_{ij} = X_{ij} - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}X_{kj}$.

Armed with this wisdom, we attempt first simply set the intercept eqault to _False_ in our implementation of Ridge regression for a vanilla data set.

The results here agree when we force _Scikit-Learn_'s Ridge function to include the first column in our design matrix.
The problem however is that can easily lead to a larger mean-squared error!

Let us see how we can change this code by zero centering.

=====  More complicated Example: The Ising model =====

The one-dimensional Ising model with nearest neighbor interaction, no
external field and a constant coupling constant $J$ is given by

!bt
\begin{align}
    H = -J \sum_{k}^L s_k s_{k + 1},
\end{align}
!et

where $s_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ and $s_{N + 1} = s_1$. The number of spins
in the system is determined by $L$. For the one-dimensional system
there is no phase transition.

We will look at a system of $L = 40$ spins with a coupling constant of
$J = 1$. To get enough training data we will generate 10000 states
with their respective energies.


!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable
import seaborn as sns
import scipy.linalg as scl
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import tqdm
sns.set(color_codes=True)
cmap_args=dict(vmin=-1., vmax=1., cmap='seismic')

L = 40
n = int(1e4)

spins = np.random.choice([-1, 1], size=(n, L))
J = 1.0

energies = np.zeros(n)

for i in range(n):
    energies[i] = - J * np.dot(spins[i], np.roll(spins[i], 1))
!ec

Here we use ordinary least squares
regression to predict the energy for the nearest neighbor
one-dimensional Ising model on a ring, i.e., the endpoints wrap
around. We will use linear regression to fit a value for
the coupling constant to achieve this.

!split
===== Reformulating the problem to suit regression =====

A more general form for the one-dimensional Ising model is

!bt
\begin{align}
    H = - \sum_j^L \sum_k^L s_j s_k J_{jk}.
\end{align}
!et

Here we allow for interactions beyond the nearest neighbors and a state dependent
coupling constant. This latter expression can be formulated as
a matrix-product
!bt
\begin{align}
    \bm{H} = \bm{X} J,
\end{align}
!et

where $X_{jk} = s_j s_k$ and $J$ is a matrix which consists of the
elements $-J_{jk}$. This form of writing the energy fits perfectly
with the form utilized in linear regression, that is

!bt
\begin{align}
    \bm{y} = \bm{X}\bm{\beta} + \bm{\epsilon},
\end{align}
!et

We split the data in training and test data as discussed in the previous example

!bc pycod
X = np.zeros((n, L ** 2))
for i in range(n):
    X[i] = np.outer(spins[i], spins[i]).ravel()
y = energies
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
!ec

!split
===== Linear regression =====

In the ordinary least squares method we choose the cost function

!bt
\begin{align}
    C(\bm{X}, \bm{\beta})= \frac{1}{n}\left\{(\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y})^T(\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y})\right\}.
\end{align}
!et

We then find the extremal point of $C$ by taking the derivative with respect to $\bm{\beta}$ as discussed above.
This yields the expression for $\bm{\beta}$ to be

!bt
\[
    \bm{\beta} = \frac{\bm{X}^T \bm{y}}{\bm{X}^T \bm{X}},
\]
!et

which immediately imposes some requirements on $\bm{X}$ as there must exist
an inverse of $\bm{X}^T \bm{X}$. If the expression we are modeling contains an
intercept, i.e., a constant term, we must make sure that the
first column of $\bm{X}$ consists of $1$. We do this here

!bc pycod
X_train_own = np.concatenate(
    (np.ones(len(X_train))[:, np.newaxis], X_train),
    axis=1
)
X_test_own = np.concatenate(
    (np.ones(len(X_test))[:, np.newaxis], X_test),
    axis=1
)
!ec

!bc pycod
def ols_inv(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    return scl.inv(x.T @ x) @ (x.T @ y)
beta = ols_inv(X_train_own, y_train)
!ec


!split
===== Singular Value decomposition =====

Doing the inversion directly turns out to be a bad idea since the matrix
$\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is singular. An alternative approach is to use the _singular
value decomposition_. Using the definition of the Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse we can write the equation for $\bm{\beta}$ as

!bt
\[
    \bm{\beta} = \bm{X}^{+}\bm{y},
\]
!et

where the pseudoinverse of $\bm{X}$ is given by

!bt
\[
    \bm{X}^{+} = \frac{\bm{X}^T}{\bm{X}^T\bm{X}}.
\]
!et

Using singular value decomposition we can decompose the matrix  $\bm{X} = \bm{U}\bm{\Sigma} \bm{V}^T$,
where $\bm{U}$ and $\bm{V}$ are orthogonal(unitary) matrices and $\bm{\Sigma}$ contains the singular values (more details below).
where $X^{+} = V\Sigma^{+} U^T$. This reduces the equation for
$\omega$ to
!bt
\begin{align}
    \bm{\beta} = \bm{V}\bm{\Sigma}^{+} \bm{U}^T \bm{y}.
\end{align}
!et

Note that solving this equation by actually doing the pseudoinverse
(which is what we will do) is not a good idea as this operation scales
as $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in a
general matrix. Instead, doing $QR$-factorization and solving the
linear system as an equation would reduce this down to
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ operations.


!bc pycod
def ols_svd(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    u, s, v = scl.svd(x)
    return v.T @ scl.pinv(scl.diagsvd(s, u.shape[0], v.shape[0])) @ u.T @ y
!ec

!bc pycod
beta = ols_svd(X_train_own,y_train)
!ec

When extracting the $J$-matrix  we need to make sure that we remove the intercept, as is done here

!bc pycod
J = beta[1:].reshape(L, L)
!ec

A way of looking at the coefficients in $J$ is to plot the matrices as images.


!bc pycod
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))
im = plt.imshow(J, **cmap_args)
plt.title("OLS", fontsize=18)
plt.xticks(fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=18)
cb = fig.colorbar(im)
cb.ax.set_yticklabels(cb.ax.get_yticklabels(), fontsize=18)
plt.show()
!ec
It is interesting to note that OLS
considers both $J_{j, j + 1} = -0.5$ and $J_{j, j - 1} = -0.5$ as
valid matrix elements for $J$.
In our discussion below on hyperparameters and Ridge and Lasso regression we will see that
this problem can be removed, partly and only with Lasso regression. 

In this case our matrix inversion was actually possible. The obvious question now is what is the mathematics behind the SVD?





!split
===== The one-dimensional Ising model =====

Let us bring back the Ising model again, but now with an additional
focus on Ridge and Lasso regression as well. We repeat some of the
basic parts of the Ising model and the setup of the training and test
data.  The one-dimensional Ising model with nearest neighbor
interaction, no external field and a constant coupling constant $J$ is
given by

!bt
\begin{align}
    H = -J \sum_{k}^L s_k s_{k + 1},
\end{align}
!et
where $s_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ and $s_{N + 1} = s_1$. The number of spins in the system is determined by $L$. For the one-dimensional system there is no phase transition.

We will look at a system of $L = 40$ spins with a coupling constant of $J = 1$. To get enough training data we will generate 10000 states with their respective energies.


!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable
import seaborn as sns
import scipy.linalg as scl
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import sklearn.linear_model as skl
import tqdm
sns.set(color_codes=True)
cmap_args=dict(vmin=-1., vmax=1., cmap='seismic')

L = 40
n = int(1e4)

spins = np.random.choice([-1, 1], size=(n, L))
J = 1.0

energies = np.zeros(n)

for i in range(n):
    energies[i] = - J * np.dot(spins[i], np.roll(spins[i], 1))
!ec

A more general form for the one-dimensional Ising model is

!bt
\begin{align}
    H = - \sum_j^L \sum_k^L s_j s_k J_{jk}.
\end{align}
!et

Here we allow for interactions beyond the nearest neighbors and a more
adaptive coupling matrix. This latter expression can be formulated as
a matrix-product on the form
!bt
\begin{align}
    H = X J,
\end{align}
!et

where $X_{jk} = s_j s_k$ and $J$ is the matrix consisting of the
elements $-J_{jk}$. This form of writing the energy fits perfectly
with the form utilized in linear regression, viz.
!bt
\begin{align}
    \bm{y} = \bm{X}\bm{\beta} + \bm{\epsilon}.
\end{align}
!et
We organize the data as we did above
!bc pycod
X = np.zeros((n, L ** 2))
for i in range(n):
    X[i] = np.outer(spins[i], spins[i]).ravel()
y = energies
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.96)

X_train_own = np.concatenate(
    (np.ones(len(X_train))[:, np.newaxis], X_train),
    axis=1
)

X_test_own = np.concatenate(
    (np.ones(len(X_test))[:, np.newaxis], X_test),
    axis=1
)
!ec

We will do all fitting with _Scikit-Learn_,

!bc pycod
clf = skl.LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
!ec
When  extracting the $J$-matrix we make sure to remove the intercept
!bc pycod
J_sk = clf.coef_.reshape(L, L)
!ec
And then we plot the results
!bc pycod
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))
im = plt.imshow(J_sk, **cmap_args)
plt.title("LinearRegression from Scikit-learn", fontsize=18)
plt.xticks(fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=18)
cb = fig.colorbar(im)
cb.ax.set_yticklabels(cb.ax.get_yticklabels(), fontsize=18)
plt.show()
!ec
The results perfectly with our previous discussion where we used our own code.

!split
===== Ridge regression =====

Having explored the ordinary least squares we move on to ridge
regression. In ridge regression we include a _regularizer_. This
involves a new cost function which leads to a new estimate for the
weights $\bm{\beta}$. This results in a penalized regression problem. The
cost function is given by

!bt
\begin{align}
    C(\bm{X}, \bm{\beta}; \lambda) = (\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y})^T(\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y}) + \lambda \bm{\beta}^T\bm{\beta}.
\end{align}
!et
!bc pycod
_lambda = 0.1
clf_ridge = skl.Ridge(alpha=_lambda).fit(X_train, y_train)
J_ridge_sk = clf_ridge.coef_.reshape(L, L)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))
im = plt.imshow(J_ridge_sk, **cmap_args)
plt.title("Ridge from Scikit-learn", fontsize=18)
plt.xticks(fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=18)
cb = fig.colorbar(im)
cb.ax.set_yticklabels(cb.ax.get_yticklabels(), fontsize=18)

plt.show()
!ec

!split
===== LASSO regression =====

In the _Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator_ (LASSO)-method we get a third cost function.

!bt
\begin{align}
    C(\bm{X}, \bm{\beta}; \lambda) = (\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y})^T(\bm{X}\bm{\beta} - \bm{y}) + \lambda \sqrt{\bm{\beta}^T\bm{\beta}}.
\end{align}
!et

Finding the extremal point of this cost function is not so straight-forward as in least squares and ridge. We will therefore rely solely on the function ``Lasso`` from _Scikit-Learn_.

!bc pycod
clf_lasso = skl.Lasso(alpha=_lambda).fit(X_train, y_train)
J_lasso_sk = clf_lasso.coef_.reshape(L, L)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))
im = plt.imshow(J_lasso_sk, **cmap_args)
plt.title("Lasso from Scikit-learn", fontsize=18)
plt.xticks(fontsize=18)
plt.yticks(fontsize=18)
cb = fig.colorbar(im)
cb.ax.set_yticklabels(cb.ax.get_yticklabels(), fontsize=18)

plt.show()
!ec

It is quite striking how LASSO breaks the symmetry of the coupling
constant as opposed to ridge and OLS. We get a sparse solution with
$J_{j, j + 1} = -1$.



!split
===== Performance as  function of the regularization parameter =====

We see how the different models perform for a different set of values for $\lambda$.


!bc pycod
lambdas = np.logspace(-4, 5, 10)

train_errors = {
    "ols_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size),
    "ridge_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size),
    "lasso_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size)
}

test_errors = {
    "ols_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size),
    "ridge_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size),
    "lasso_sk": np.zeros(lambdas.size)
}

plot_counter = 1

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(32, 54))

for i, _lambda in enumerate(tqdm.tqdm(lambdas)):
    for key, method in zip(
        ["ols_sk", "ridge_sk", "lasso_sk"],
        [skl.LinearRegression(), skl.Ridge(alpha=_lambda), skl.Lasso(alpha=_lambda)]
    ):
        method = method.fit(X_train, y_train)

        train_errors[key][i] = method.score(X_train, y_train)
        test_errors[key][i] = method.score(X_test, y_test)

        omega = method.coef_.reshape(L, L)

        plt.subplot(10, 5, plot_counter)
        plt.imshow(omega, **cmap_args)
        plt.title(r"%s, $\lambda = %.4f$" % (key, _lambda))
        plot_counter += 1

plt.show()
!ec

We see that LASSO reaches a good solution for low
values of $\lambda$, but will "wither" when we increase $\lambda$ too
much. Ridge is more stable over a larger range of values for
$\lambda$, but eventually also fades away.

!split
===== Finding the optimal value of $\lambda$ =====

To determine which value of $\lambda$ is best we plot the accuracy of
the models when predicting the training and the testing set. We expect
the accuracy of the training set to be quite good, but if the accuracy
of the testing set is much lower this tells us that we might be
subject to an overfit model. The ideal scenario is an accuracy on the
testing set that is close to the accuracy of the training set.


!bc pycod 
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 14))

colors = {
    "ols_sk": "r",
    "ridge_sk": "y",
    "lasso_sk": "c"
}

for key in train_errors:
    plt.semilogx(
        lambdas,
        train_errors[key],
        colors[key],
        label="Train {0}".format(key),
        linewidth=4.0
    )

for key in test_errors:
    plt.semilogx(
        lambdas,
        test_errors[key],
        colors[key] + "--",
        label="Test {0}".format(key),
        linewidth=4.0
    )
plt.legend(loc="best", fontsize=18)
plt.xlabel(r"$\lambda$", fontsize=18)
plt.ylabel(r"$R^2$", fontsize=18)
plt.tick_params(labelsize=18)
plt.show()
!ec

From the above figure we can see that LASSO with $\lambda = 10^{-2}$
achieves a very good accuracy on the test set. This by far surpasses the
other models for all values of $\lambda$.







!split 
===== Logistic Regression =====

In linear regression our main interest was centered on learning the
coefficients of a functional fit (say a polynomial) in order to be
able to predict the response of a continuous variable on some unseen
data. The fit to the continuous variable $y_i$ is based on some
independent variables $\bm{x}_i$. Linear regression resulted in
analytical expressions for standard ordinary Least Squares or Ridge
regression (in terms of matrices to invert) for several quantities,
ranging from the variance and thereby the confidence intervals of the
parameters $\bm{\beta}$ to the mean squared error. If we can invert
the product of the design matrices, linear regression gives then a
simple recipe for fitting our data.

!split 
===== Classification problems =====


Classification problems, however, are concerned with outcomes taking
the form of discrete variables (i.e. categories). We may for example,
on the basis of DNA sequencing for a number of patients, like to find
out which mutations are important for a certain disease; or based on
scans of various patients' brains, figure out if there is a tumor or
not; or given a specific physical system, we'd like to identify its
state, say whether it is an ordered or disordered system (typical
situation in solid state physics); or classify the status of a
patient, whether she/he has a stroke or not and many other similar
situations.

The most common situation we encounter when we apply logistic
regression is that of two possible outcomes, normally denoted as a
binary outcome, true or false, positive or negative, success or
failure etc.

!split
===== Optimization and Deep learning =====

Logistic regression will also serve as our stepping stone towards
neural network algorithms and supervised deep learning. For logistic
learning, the minimization of the cost function leads to a non-linear
equation in the parameters $\bm{\beta}$. The optimization of the
problem calls therefore for minimization algorithms. This forms the
bottle neck of all machine learning algorithms, namely how to find
reliable minima of a multi-variable function. This leads us to the
family of gradient descent methods. The latter are the working horses
of basically all modern machine learning algorithms.

We note also that many of the topics discussed here on logistic 
regression are also commonly used in modern supervised Deep Learning
models, as we will see later.


!split 
===== Basics =====

We consider the case where the dependent variables, also called the
responses or the outcomes, $y_i$ are discrete and only take values
from $k=0,\dots,K-1$ (i.e. $K$ classes).

The goal is to predict the
output classes from the design matrix $\bm{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$
made of $n$ samples, each of which carries $p$ features or predictors. The
primary goal is to identify the classes to which new unseen samples
belong.
 
Let us specialize to the case of two classes only, with outputs
$y_i=0$ and $y_i=1$. Our outcomes could represent the status of a
credit card user that could default or not on her/his credit card
debt. That is


!bt
\[
y_i = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \mathrm{no}\\  1 & \mathrm{yes} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et



!split
===== Linear classifier =====

Before moving to the logistic model, let us try to use our linear
regression model to classify these two outcomes. We could for example
fit a linear model to the default case if $y_i > 0.5$ and the no
default case $y_i \leq 0.5$.

We would then have our 
weighted linear combination, namely 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\bm{y} = \bm{X}^T\bm{\beta} +  \bm{\epsilon},
\end{equation}
!et
where $\bm{y}$ is a vector representing the possible outcomes, $\bm{X}$ is our
$n\times p$ design matrix and $\bm{\beta}$ represents our estimators/predictors.

!split
===== Some selected properties =====

The main problem with our function is that it takes values on the
entire real axis. In the case of logistic regression, however, the
labels $y_i$ are discrete variables. A typical example is the credit
card data discussed below here, where we can set the state of
defaulting the debt to $y_i=1$ and not to $y_i=0$ for one the persons
in the data set (see the full example below).

One simple way to get a discrete output is to have sign
functions that map the output of a linear regressor to values $\{0,1\}$,
$f(s_i)=sign(s_i)=1$ if $s_i\ge 0$ and 0 if otherwise. 
We will encounter this model in our first demonstration of neural networks. Historically it is called the ``perceptron" model in the machine learning
literature. This model is extremely simple. However, in many cases it is more
favorable to use a ``soft" classifier that outputs
the probability of a given category. This leads us to the logistic function.

!split
===== Simple example =====

The following example on data for coronary heart disease (CHD) as function of age may serve as an illustration. In the code here we read and plot whether a person has had CHD (output = 1) or not (output = 0). This ouput  is plotted the person's against age. Clearly, the figure shows that attempting to make a standard linear regression fit may not be very meaningful.

===== Plotting the mean value for each group =====

What we could attempt however is to plot the mean value for each group.

!bc pycod
agegroupmean = np.array([0.1, 0.133, 0.250, 0.333, 0.462, 0.625, 0.765, 0.800])

plt.axis([0,9,0, 1.0])
plt.xlabel(r'Age group')
plt.ylabel(r'CHD mean values')
plt.title(r'Mean values for each age group')
plt.show()
!ec

We are now trying to find a function $f(y\vert x)$, that is a function which gives us an expected value for the output $y$ with a given input $x$.
In standard linear regression with a linear dependence on $x$, we would write this in terms of our model
!bt
\[
f(y_i\vert x_i)=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_i.
\]
!et

This expression implies however that $f(y_i\vert x_i)$ could take any
value from minus infinity to plus infinity. If we however let
$f(y\vert y)$ be represented by the mean value, the above example
shows us that we can constrain the function to take values between
zero and one, that is we have $0 \le f(y_i\vert x_i) \le 1$. Looking
at our last curve we see also that it has an S-shaped form. This leads
us to a very popular model for the function $f$, namely the so-called
Sigmoid function or logistic model. We will consider this function as
representing the probability for finding a value of $y_i$ with a given
$x_i$.

!split
===== The logistic function =====

Another widely studied model, is the so-called 
perceptron model, which is an example of a ``hard classification'' model. We
will encounter this model when we discuss neural networks as
well. Each datapoint is deterministically assigned to a category (i.e
$y_i=0$ or $y_i=1$). In many cases, and the coronary heart disease data forms one of many such examples, it is favorable to have a ``soft''
classifier that outputs the probability of a given category rather
than a single value. For example, given $x_i$, the classifier
outputs the probability of being in a category $k$.  Logistic regression
is the most common example of a so-called soft classifier. In logistic
regression, the probability that a data point $x_i$
belongs to a category $y_i=\{0,1\}$ is given by the so-called logit function (or Sigmoid) which is meant to represent the likelihood for a given event, 
!bt
\[
p(t) = \frac{1}{1+\mathrm \exp{-t}}=\frac{\exp{t}}{1+\mathrm \exp{t}}.
\]
!et
Note that $1-p(t)= p(-t)$.

!split
=====  Two parameters =====

We assume now that we have two classes with $y_i$ either $0$ or $1$. Furthermore we assume also that we have only two parameters $\beta$ in our fitting of the Sigmoid function, that is we define probabilities 
!bt
\begin{align*}
p(y_i=1|x_i,\bm{\beta}) &= \frac{\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}},\nonumber\\
p(y_i=0|x_i,\bm{\beta}) &= 1 - p(y_i=1|x_i,\bm{\beta}),
\end{align*}
!et
where $\bm{\beta}$ are the weights we wish to extract from data, in our case $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. 

Note that we used
!bt
\[
p(y_i=0\vert x_i, \bm{\beta}) = 1-p(y_i=1\vert x_i, \bm{\beta}).
\]
!et

!split 
===== Maximum likelihood =====

In order to define the total likelihood for all possible outcomes from a  
dataset $\mathcal{D}=\{(y_i,x_i)\}$, with the binary labels
$y_i\in\{0,1\}$ and where the data points are drawn independently, we use the so-called "Maximum Likelihood Estimation":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation" (MLE) principle. 
We aim thus at maximizing 
the probability of seeing the observed data. We can then approximate the 
likelihood in terms of the product of the individual probabilities of a specific outcome $y_i$, that is 
!bt
\begin{align*}
P(\mathcal{D}|\bm{\beta})& = \prod_{i=1}^n \left[p(y_i=1|x_i,\bm{\beta})\right]^{y_i}\left[1-p(y_i=1|x_i,\bm{\beta}))\right]^{1-y_i}\nonumber \\
\end{align*}
!et
from which we obtain the log-likelihood and our _cost/loss_ function
!bt
\[
\mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( y_i\log{p(y_i=1|x_i,\bm{\beta})} + (1-y_i)\log\left[1-p(y_i=1|x_i,\bm{\beta}))\right]\right).
\]
!et

!split
===== The cost function rewritten =====

Reordering the logarithms, we can rewrite the _cost/loss_ function as
!bt
\[
\mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta}) = \sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_i(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i) -\log{(1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)})}\right).
\]
!et

The maximum likelihood estimator is defined as the set of parameters that maximize the log-likelihood where we maximize with respect to $\beta$.
Since the cost (error) function is just the negative log-likelihood, for logistic regression we have that
!bt
\[
\mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta})=-\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_i(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i) -\log{(1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)})}\right).
\]
!et
This equation is known in statistics as the _cross entropy_. Finally, we note that just as in linear regression, 
in practice we often supplement the cross-entropy with additional regularization terms, usually $L_1$ and $L_2$ regularization as we did for Ridge and Lasso regression.

!split
=====  Minimizing the cross entropy =====

The cross entropy is a convex function of the weights $\bm{\beta}$ and,
therefore, any local minimizer is a global minimizer. 


Minimizing this
cost function with respect to the two parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ we obtain

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \beta_0} = -\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_i -\frac{\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}\right),
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \beta_1} = -\sum_{i=1}^n  \left(y_ix_i -x_i\frac{\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}\right).
\]
!et

!split
=====  A more compact expression =====

Let us now define a vector $\bm{y}$ with $n$ elements $y_i$, an
$n\times p$ matrix $\bm{X}$ which contains the $x_i$ values and a
vector $\bm{p}$ of fitted probabilities $p(y_i\vert x_i,\bm{\beta})$. We can rewrite in a more compact form the first
derivative of cost function as

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}} = -\bm{X}^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{p}\right). 
\]
!et

If we in addition define a diagonal matrix $\bm{W}$ with elements 
$p(y_i\vert x_i,\bm{\beta})(1-p(y_i\vert x_i,\bm{\beta})$, we can obtain a compact expression of the second derivative as 

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}\partial \bm{\beta}^T} = \bm{X}^T\bm{W}\bm{X}. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Extending to more predictors =====

Within a binary classification problem, we can easily expand our model to include multiple predictors. Our ratio between likelihoods is then with $p$ predictors
!bt
\[
\log{ \frac{p(\bm{\beta}\bm{x})}{1-p(\bm{\beta}\bm{x})}} = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\dots+\beta_px_p.
\]
!et
Here we defined $\bm{x}=[1,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_p]$ and $\bm{\beta}=[\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p]$ leading to
!bt
\[
p(\bm{\beta}\bm{x})=\frac{ \exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\dots+\beta_px_p)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\dots+\beta_px_p)}}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Including more classes =====

Till now we have mainly focused on two classes, the so-called binary
system. Suppose we wish to extend to $K$ classes.  Let us for the sake
of simplicity assume we have only two predictors. We have then following model

!bt
\[
\log{\frac{p(C=1\vert x)}{p(K\vert x)}} = \beta_{10}+\beta_{11}x_1,
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\log{\frac{p(C=2\vert x)}{p(K\vert x)}} = \beta_{20}+\beta_{21}x_1,
\]
!et
and so on till the class $C=K-1$ class
!bt
\[
\log{\frac{p(C=K-1\vert x)}{p(K\vert x)}} = \beta_{(K-1)0}+\beta_{(K-1)1}x_1,
\]
!et

and the model is specified in term of $K-1$ so-called log-odds or
_logit_ transformations.


!split
===== More classes =====

In our discussion of neural networks we will encounter the above again
in terms of a slightly modified function, the so-called _Softmax_ function.

The softmax function is used in various multiclass classification
methods, such as multinomial logistic regression (also known as
softmax regression), multiclass linear discriminant analysis, naive
Bayes classifiers, and artificial neural networks.  Specifically, in
multinomial logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis, the
input to the function is the result of $K$ distinct linear functions,
and the predicted probability for the $k$-th class given a sample
vector $\bm{x}$ and a weighting vector $\bm{\beta}$ is (with two
predictors):

!bt
\[
p(C=k\vert \mathbf {x} )=\frac{\exp{(\beta_{k0}+\beta_{k1}x_1)}}{1+\sum_{l=1}^{K-1}\exp{(\beta_{l0}+\beta_{l1}x_1)}}.
\]
!et
It is easy to extend to more predictors. The final class is 
!bt
\[
p(C=K\vert \mathbf {x} )=\frac{1}{1+\sum_{l=1}^{K-1}\exp{(\beta_{l0}+\beta_{l1}x_1)}},
\]
!et

and they sum to one. Our earlier discussions were all specialized to
the case with two classes only. It is easy to see from the above that
what we derived earlier is compatible with these equations.

To find the optimal parameters we would typically use a gradient
descent method.  Newton's method and gradient descent methods are
discussed in the material on "optimization
methods":"https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/Splines/html/Splines-bs.html".

In addition to the above scores, we could also study the covariance (and the correlation matrix).
We use _Pandas_ to compute the correlation matrix.

# use the heatmap function from seaborn to plot the correlation matrix
# annot = True to print the values inside the square
plt.figure(figsize=(15,8))
sns.heatmap(data=correlation_matrix, annot=True)
plt.show()

!split
===== Discussing the correlation data =====

In the above example we note two things. In the first plot we display
the overlap of benign and malignant tumors as functions of the various
features in the Wisconsing breast cancer data set. We see that for
some of the features we can distinguish clearly the benign and
malignant cases while for other features we cannot. This can point to
us which features may be of greater interest when we wish to classify
a benign or not benign tumour.

In the second figure we have computed the so-called correlation
matrix, which in our case with thirty features becomes a $30\times 30$
matrix.

We constructed this matrix using _pandas_ via the statements
!bc pycod
cancerpd = pd.DataFrame(cancer.data, columns=cancer.feature_names)
!ec
and then
!bc pycod
correlation_matrix = cancerpd.corr().round(1)
!ec

Diagonalizing this matrix we can in turn say something about which
features are of relevance and which are not. This leads  us to
the classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) theorem with
applications. This will be discussed later this semester ("week 43":"https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/week43/html/week43-bs.html").

===== Optimization, the central part of any Machine Learning algortithm =====

"Overview Video, why do we care about gradient methods?":"https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS-STK3155/h20/forelesningsvideoer/OverarchingAimsWeek39.mp4?vrtx=view-as-webpage"



Almost every problem in machine learning and data science starts with
a dataset $X$, a model $g(\beta)$, which is a function of the
parameters $\beta$ and a cost function $C(X, g(\beta))$ that allows
us to judge how well the model $g(\beta)$ explains the observations
$X$. The model is fit by finding the values of $\beta$ that minimize
the cost function. Ideally we would be able to solve for $\beta$
analytically, however this is not possible in general and we must use
some approximative/numerical method to compute the minimum.


!split
=====  Revisiting our Logistic Regression case =====

In our discussion on Logistic Regression we studied the 
case of
two classes, with $y_i$ either
$0$ or $1$. Furthermore we assumed also that we have only two
parameters $\beta$ in our fitting, that is we
defined probabilities

!bt
\begin{align*}
p(y_i=1|x_i,\bm{\beta}) &= \frac{\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}{1+\exp{(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}},\nonumber\\
p(y_i=0|x_i,\bm{\beta}) &= 1 - p(y_i=1|x_i,\bm{\beta}),
\end{align*}
!et
where $\bm{\beta}$ are the weights we wish to extract from data, in our case $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. 

!split
===== The equations to solve =====

Our compact equations used a definition of a vector $\bm{y}$ with $n$
elements $y_i$, an $n\times p$ matrix $\bm{X}$ which contains the
$x_i$ values and a vector $\bm{p}$ of fitted probabilities
$p(y_i\vert x_i,\bm{\beta})$. We rewrote in a more compact form
the first derivative of the cost function as

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}} = -\bm{X}^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{p}\right). 
\]
!et

If we in addition define a diagonal matrix $\bm{W}$ with elements 
$p(y_i\vert x_i,\bm{\beta})(1-p(y_i\vert x_i,\bm{\beta})$, we can obtain a compact expression of the second derivative as 

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}\partial \bm{\beta}^T} = \bm{X}^T\bm{W}\bm{X}. 
\]
!et
This defines what is called  the Hessian matrix.

!split
===== Solving using Newton-Raphson's method =====

If we can set up these equations, Newton-Raphson's iterative method is normally the method of choice. It requires however that we can compute in an efficient way the  matrices that define the first and second derivatives. 

Our iterative scheme is then given by

!bt
\[
\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{new}} = \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{old}}-\left(\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}\partial \bm{\beta}^T}\right)^{-1}_{\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{old}}}\times \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}}\right)_{\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{old}}},
\]
!et
or in matrix form as

!bt
\[
\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{new}} = \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{old}}-\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{W}\bm{X} \right)^{-1}\times \left(-\bm{X}^T(\bm{y}-\bm{p}) \right)_{\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{old}}}.
\]
!et
The right-hand side is computed with the old values of $\beta$. 

If we can compute these matrices, in particular the Hessian, the above is often the easiest method to implement. 


!split
===== Brief reminder on Newton-Raphson's method =====

Let us quickly remind ourselves how we derive the above method.

Perhaps the most celebrated of all one-dimensional root-finding
routines is Newton's method, also called the Newton-Raphson
method. This method  requires the evaluation of both the
function $f$ and its derivative $f'$ at arbitrary points. 
If you can only calculate the derivative
numerically and/or your function is not of the smooth type, we
normally discourage the use of this method.

!split
===== The equations =====

The Newton-Raphson formula consists geometrically of extending the
tangent line at a current point until it crosses zero, then setting
the next guess to the abscissa of that zero-crossing.  The mathematics
behind this method is rather simple. Employing a Taylor expansion for
$x$ sufficiently close to the solution $s$, we have


!bt
\[
    f(s)=0=f(x)+(s-x)f'(x)+\frac{(s-x)^2}{2}f''(x) +\dots.
    \label{eq:taylornr}
\]
!et

For small enough values of the function and for well-behaved
functions, the terms beyond linear are unimportant, hence we obtain


!bt
\[
   f(x)+(s-x)f'(x)\approx 0,
\]
!et
yielding
!bt
\[
   s\approx x-\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}.
\]
!et

Having in mind an iterative procedure, it is natural to start iterating with
!bt
\[
   x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Simple geometric interpretation =====

The above is Newton-Raphson's method. It has a simple geometric
interpretation, namely $x_{n+1}$ is the point where the tangent from
$(x_n,f(x_n))$ crosses the $x$-axis.  Close to the solution,
Newton-Raphson converges fast to the desired result. However, if we
are far from a root, where the higher-order terms in the series are
important, the Newton-Raphson formula can give grossly inaccurate
results. For instance, the initial guess for the root might be so far
from the true root as to let the search interval include a local
maximum or minimum of the function.  If an iteration places a trial
guess near such a local extremum, so that the first derivative nearly
vanishes, then Newton-Raphson may fail totally


!split
===== Extending to more than one variable =====

Newton's method can be generalized to systems of several non-linear equations
and variables. Consider the case with two equations
!bt
\[
   \begin{array}{cc} f_1(x_1,x_2) &=0\\
                     f_2(x_1,x_2) &=0,\end{array}
\]
!et
which we Taylor expand to obtain

!bt
\[
   \begin{array}{cc} 0=f_1(x_1+h_1,x_2+h_2)=&f_1(x_1,x_2)+h_1
                     \partial f_1/\partial x_1+h_2
                     \partial f_1/\partial x_2+\dots\\
                     0=f_2(x_1+h_1,x_2+h_2)=&f_2(x_1,x_2)+h_1
                     \partial f_2/\partial x_1+h_2
                     \partial f_2/\partial x_2+\dots
                       \end{array}.
\]
!et
Defining the Jacobian matrix ${\bf \bm{J}}$ we have
!bt
\[
 {\bf \bm{J}}=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
                         \partial f_1/\partial x_1  & \partial f_1/\partial x_2 \\
                          \partial f_2/\partial x_1     &\partial f_2/\partial x_2
             \end{array} \right),
\]
!et
we can rephrase Newton's method as
!bt
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c} x_1^{n+1} \\ x_2^{n+1} \end{array} \right)=
\left(\begin{array}{c} x_1^{n} \\ x_2^{n} \end{array} \right)+
\left(\begin{array}{c} h_1^{n} \\ h_2^{n} \end{array} \right),
\]
!et
where we have defined
!bt
\[
   \left(\begin{array}{c} h_1^{n} \\ h_2^{n} \end{array} \right)=
   -{\bf \bm{J}}^{-1}
   \left(\begin{array}{c} f_1(x_1^{n},x_2^{n}) \\ f_2(x_1^{n},x_2^{n}) \end{array} \right).
\]
!et
We need thus to compute the inverse of the Jacobian matrix and it
is to understand that difficulties  may
arise in case ${\bf \bm{J}}$ is nearly singular.

It is rather straightforward to extend the above scheme to systems of
more than two non-linear equations. In our case, the Jacobian matrix is given by the Hessian that represents the second derivative of cost function. 



!split
===== Steepest descent =====

The basic idea of gradient descent is
that a function $F(\mathbf{x})$, 
$\mathbf{x} \equiv (x_1,\cdots,x_n)$, decreases fastest if one goes from $\bf {x}$ in the
direction of the negative gradient $-\nabla F(\mathbf{x})$.

It can be shown that if 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \gamma_k \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_k),
\]
!et
with $\gamma_k > 0$.

For $\gamma_k$ small enough, then $F(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \leq
F(\mathbf{x}_k)$. This means that for a sufficiently small $\gamma_k$
we are always moving towards smaller function values, i.e a minimum.

!split 
===== More on Steepest descent =====

The previous observation is the basis of the method of steepest
descent, which is also referred to as just gradient descent (GD). One
starts with an initial guess $\mathbf{x}_0$ for a minimum of $F$ and
computes new approximations according to

!bt
\[
\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k - \gamma_k \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_k), \ \ k \geq 0.
\]
!et

The parameter $\gamma_k$ is often referred to as the step length or
the learning rate within the context of Machine Learning.

!split 
===== The ideal =====

Ideally the sequence $\{\mathbf{x}_k \}_{k=0}$ converges to a global
minimum of the function $F$. In general we do not know if we are in a
global or local minimum. In the special case when $F$ is a convex
function, all local minima are also global minima, so in this case
gradient descent can converge to the global solution. The advantage of
this scheme is that it is conceptually simple and straightforward to
implement. However the method in this form has some severe
limitations:

In machine learing we are often faced with non-convex high dimensional
cost functions with many local minima. Since GD is deterministic we
will get stuck in a local minimum, if the method converges, unless we
have a very good intial guess. This also implies that the scheme is
sensitive to the chosen initial condition.

Note that the gradient is a function of $\mathbf{x} =
(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ which makes it expensive to compute numerically.


!split 
===== The sensitiveness of the gradient descent ===== 

The gradient descent method 
is sensitive to the choice of learning rate $\gamma_k$. This is due
to the fact that we are only guaranteed that $F(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}) \leq
F(\mathbf{x}_k)$ for sufficiently small $\gamma_k$. The problem is to
determine an optimal learning rate. If the learning rate is chosen too
small the method will take a long time to converge and if it is too
large we can experience erratic behavior.

Many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by introducing
randomness. One such method is that of Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD), see below.


!split 
===== Convex functions ===== 

Ideally we want our cost/loss function to be convex(concave).

First we give the definition of a convex set: A set $C$ in
$\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be convex if, for all $x$ and $y$ in $C$ and
all $t \in (0,1)$ , the point $(1 − t)x + ty$ also belongs to
C. Geometrically this means that every point on the line segment
connecting $x$ and $y$ is in $C$ as discussed below.

The convex subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are the intervals of
$\mathbb{R}$. Examples of convex sets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ are the
regular polygons (triangles, rectangles, pentagons, etc...).

!split
===== Convex function =====

_Convex function_: Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a convex set. Assume that the function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then $f$ is said to be convex if $$f(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2) \leq tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2) $$ for all $x_1, x_2 \in X$ and for all $t \in [0,1]$. If $\leq$ is replaced with a strict inequaltiy in the definition, we demand $x_1 \neq x_2$ and $t\in(0,1)$ then $f$ is said to be strictly convex. For a single variable function, convexity means that if you draw a straight line connecting $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$, the value of the function on the interval $[x_1,x_2]$ is always below the line as illustrated below.

!split
===== Conditions on convex functions =====

In the following we state first and second-order conditions which
ensures convexity of a function $f$. We write $D_f$ to denote the
domain of $f$, i.e the subset of $R^n$ where $f$ is defined. For more
details and proofs we refer to: "S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe. Convex Optimization. Cambridge University Press":"http://stanford.edu/boyd/cvxbook/, 2004".

!bblock First order condition
Suppose $f$ is differentiable (i.e $\nabla f(x)$ is well defined for
all $x$ in the domain of $f$). Then $f$ is convex if and only if $D_f$
is a convex set and $$f(y) \geq f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y-x) $$ holds
for all $x,y \in D_f$. This condition means that for a convex function
the first order Taylor expansion (right hand side above) at any point
a global under estimator of the function. To convince yourself you can
make a drawing of $f(x) = x^2+1$ and draw the tangent line to $f(x)$ and
note that it is always below the graph.  
!eblock

!bblock Second order condition 
Assume that $f$ is twice
differentiable, i.e the Hessian matrix exists at each point in
$D_f$. Then $f$ is convex if and only if $D_f$ is a convex set and its
Hessian is positive semi-definite for all $x\in D_f$. For a
single-variable function this reduces to $f''(x) \geq 0$. Geometrically this means that $f$ has nonnegative curvature
everywhere.
!eblock

This condition is particularly useful since it gives us an procedure for determining if the function under consideration is convex, apart from using the definition.

!split
===== More on convex functions =====

The next result is of great importance to us and the reason why we are
going on about convex functions. In machine learning we frequently
have to minimize a loss/cost function in order to find the best
parameters for the model we are considering. 

Ideally we want the
global minimum (for high-dimensional models it is hard to know
if we have local or global minimum). However, if the cost/loss function
is convex the following result provides invaluable information:

!bblock Any minimum is global for convex functions
Consider the problem of finding $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $f(x)$
is minimal, where $f$ is convex and differentiable. Then, any point
$x^*$ that satisfies $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$ is a global minimum.
!eblock

This result means that if we know that the cost/loss function is convex and we are able to find a minimum, we are guaranteed that it is a global minimum.

!split
===== Some simple problems =====

o Show that $f(x)=x^2$ is convex for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ using the definition of convexity. Hint: If you re-write the definition, $f$ is convex if the following holds for all $x,y \in D_f$ and any $\lambda \in [0,1]$ $\lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y)-f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda) y ) \geq 0$.

o Using the second order condition show that the following functions are convex on the specified domain.
 * $f(x) = e^x$ is convex for $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
 * $g(x) = -\ln(x)$ is convex for $x \in (0,\infty)$.
o Let $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = e^x$. Show that $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$ is convex for $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Also show that if $f(x)$ is any convex function than $h(x) = e^{f(x)}$ is convex.

o A norm is any function that satisfy the following properties
 * $f(\alpha x) = |\alpha| f(x)$ for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.
 * $f(x+y) \leq f(x) + f(y)$
 * $f(x) \leq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ with equality if and only if $x = 0$

Using the definition of convexity, try to show that a function satisfying the properties above is convex (the third condition is not needed to show this).

===== Standard steepest descent =====


Before we proceed, we would like to discuss the approach called the
_standard Steepest descent_ (different from the above steepest descent discussion), which again leads to us having to be able
to compute a matrix. It belongs to the class of Conjugate Gradient methods (CG).

"The success of the CG method":"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake-papers/painless-conjugate-gradient.pdf"
for finding solutions of non-linear problems is based on the theory
of conjugate gradients for linear systems of equations. It belongs to
the class of iterative methods for solving problems from linear
algebra of the type 
!bt 
\begin{equation*} 
\bm{A}\bm{x} = \bm{b}.
\end{equation*} 
!et 

In the iterative process we end up with a problem like

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \bm{r}= \bm{b}-\bm{A}\bm{x},
\end{equation*}
!et
where $\bm{r}$ is the so-called residual or error in the iterative process.

When we have found the exact solution, $\bm{r}=0$.

!split
===== Gradient method =====

The residual is zero when we reach the minimum of the quadratic equation
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  P(\bm{x})=\frac{1}{2}\bm{x}^T\bm{A}\bm{x} - \bm{x}^T\bm{b},
\end{equation*}
!et

with the constraint that the matrix $\bm{A}$ is positive definite and
symmetric.  This defines also the Hessian and we want it to be  positive definite.  


!split
===== Steepest descent  method ===== 

We denote the initial guess for $\bm{x}$ as $\bm{x}_0$. 
We can assume without loss of generality that
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{x}_0=0,
\end{equation*}
!et
or consider the system
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{A}\bm{z} = \bm{b}-\bm{A}\bm{x}_0,
\end{equation*}
!et
instead.


!split
===== Steepest descent  method ===== 
!bblock
One can show that the solution $\bm{x}$ is also the unique minimizer of the quadratic form
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  f(\bm{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\bm{x}^T\bm{A}\bm{x} - \bm{x}^T \bm{x} , \quad \bm{x}\in\mathbf{R}^n. 
\end{equation*}
!et
This suggests taking the first basis vector $\bm{r}_1$ (see below for definition) 
to be the gradient of $f$ at $\bm{x}=\bm{x}_0$, 
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{A}\bm{x}_0-\bm{b},
\end{equation*}
!et
and 
$\bm{x}_0=0$ it is equal $-\bm{b}$.

!eblock

!split
===== Final expressions ===== 
!bblock
We can compute the residual iteratively as
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{r}_{k+1}=\bm{b}-\bm{A}\bm{x}_{k+1},
 \end{equation*}
!et
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{b}-\bm{A}(\bm{x}_k+\alpha_k\bm{r}_k),
 \end{equation*}
!et
or
!bt
\begin{equation*}
(\bm{b}-\bm{A}\bm{x}_k)-\alpha_k\bm{A}\bm{r}_k,
 \end{equation*}
!et
which gives

!bt
\[
\alpha_k = \frac{\bm{r}_k^T\bm{r}_k}{\bm{r}_k^T\bm{A}\bm{r}_k}
\]
!et
leading to the iterative scheme
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{x}_{k+1}=\bm{x}_k-\alpha_k\bm{r}_{k},
 \end{equation*}
!et

===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
In the CG method we define so-called conjugate directions and two vectors 
$\bm{s}$ and $\bm{t}$
are said to be
conjugate if
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{s}^T\bm{A}\bm{t}= 0.
\end{equation*}
!et
The philosophy of the CG method is to perform searches in various conjugate directions
of our vectors $\bm{x}_i$ obeying the above criterion, namely
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{x}_i^T\bm{A}\bm{x}_j= 0.
\end{equation*}
!et
Two vectors are conjugate if they are orthogonal with respect to 
this inner product. Being conjugate is a symmetric relation: if $\bm{s}$ is conjugate to $\bm{t}$, then $\bm{t}$ is conjugate to $\bm{s}$.

===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
An example is given by the eigenvectors of the matrix
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{v}_i^T\bm{A}\bm{v}_j= \lambda\bm{v}_i^T\bm{v}_j,
\end{equation*}
!et
which is zero unless $i=j$. 
!eblock


!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
Assume now that we have a symmetric positive-definite matrix $\bm{A}$ of size
$n\times n$. At each iteration $i+1$ we obtain the conjugate direction of a vector
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{x}_{i+1}=\bm{x}_{i}+\alpha_i\bm{p}_{i}. 
\end{equation*}
!et
We assume that $\bm{p}_{i}$ is a sequence of $n$ mutually conjugate directions. 
Then the $\bm{p}_{i}$  form a basis of $R^n$ and we can expand the solution 
$  \bm{A}\bm{x} = \bm{b}$ in this basis, namely

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \bm{x}  = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha_i \bm{p}_i.
\end{equation*}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Conjugate gradient method ===== 
!bblock
The coefficients are given by
!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha_i \mathbf{A} \mathbf{p}_i = \mathbf{b}.
\end{equation*}
!et
Multiplying with $\bm{p}_k^T$  from the left gives

!bt
\begin{equation*}
  \bm{p}_k^T \bm{A}\bm{x} = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \alpha_i\bm{p}_k^T \bm{A}\bm{p}_i= \bm{p}_k^T \bm{b},
\end{equation*}
!et
and we can define the coefficients $\alpha_k$ as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
    \alpha_k = \frac{\bm{p}_k^T \bm{b}}{\bm{p}_k^T \bm{A} \bm{p}_k}
\end{equation*}
!et

===== Conjugate gradient method and iterations ===== 
!bblock

If we choose the conjugate vectors $\bm{p}_k$ carefully, 
then we may not need all of them to obtain a good approximation to the solution 
$\bm{x}$. 
We want to regard the conjugate gradient method as an iterative method. 
This will us to solve systems where $n$ is so large that the direct 
method would take too much time.

We denote the initial guess for $\bm{x}$ as $\bm{x}_0$. 
We can assume without loss of generality that
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{x}_0=0,
\end{equation*}
!et
or consider the system
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{A}\bm{z} = \bm{b}-\bm{A}\bm{x}_0,
\end{equation*}
!et
instead.

One can show that the solution $\bm{x}$ is also the unique minimizer of the quadratic form
!bt
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
!et
This suggests taking the first basis vector $\bm{p}_1$ 
to be the gradient of $f$ at $\bm{x}=\bm{x}_0$, 
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{A}\bm{x}_0-\bm{b},
\end{equation*}
!et
and 
$\bm{x}_0=0$ it is equal $-\bm{b}$.
The other vectors in the basis will be conjugate to the gradient, 
hence the name conjugate gradient method.

Let  $\bm{r}_k$ be the residual at the $k$-th step:
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{r}_k=\bm{b}-\bm{A}\bm{x}_k.
\end{equation*}
!et
Note that $\bm{r}_k$ is the negative gradient of $f$ at 
$\bm{x}=\bm{x}_k$, 
so the gradient descent method would be to move in the direction $\bm{r}_k$. 
Here, we insist that the directions $\bm{p}_k$ are conjugate to each other, 
so we take the direction closest to the gradient $\bm{r}_k$  
under the conjugacy constraint. 
This gives the following expression
!bt
\begin{equation*}
\bm{p}_{k+1}=\bm{r}_k-\frac{\bm{p}_k^T \bm{A}\bm{r}_k}{\bm{p}_k^T\bm{A}\bm{p}_k} \bm{p}_k.

===== Revisiting some of our first Linear Regression Encounters  =====

We will use linear regression as a case study for the gradient descent
methods. Linear regression is a great test case for the gradient
descent methods discussed in the lectures since it has several
desirable properties such as:

o An analytical solution (recall homework set 1).
o The gradient can be computed analytically.
o The cost function is convex which guarantees that gradient descent converges for small enough learning rates

We revisit an example similar to what we had in the first homework set. We had a function  of the type

!bc pycod
x = 2*np.random.rand(m,1)
y = 4+3*x+np.random.randn(m,1)
!ec
with $x_i \in [0,1] $ is chosen randomly using a uniform distribution. Additionally we have a stochastic noise chosen according to a normal distribution $\cal {N}(0,1)$. 
The linear regression model is given by 
!bt
\[
h_\beta(x) = \bm{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x,
\] 
!et
such that 
!bt
\[
\bm{y}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i.
\]
!et

!split 
===== Gradient descent example =====

Let $\mathbf{y} = (y_1,\cdots,y_n)^T$, $\mathbf{\bm{y}} = (\bm{y}_1,\cdots,\bm{y}_n)^T$ and $\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1)^T$

It is convenient to write $\mathbf{\bm{y}} = X\beta$ where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{100 \times 2} $ is the design matrix given by (we keep the intercept here)
!bt
\[
X \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_1  \\
\vdots & \vdots  \\
1 & x_{100} &  \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
The cost/loss/risk function is given by (
!bt
\[
C(\beta) = \frac{1}{n}||X\beta-\mathbf{y}||_{2}^{2} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{100}\left[ (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)^2 - 2 y_i (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i) + y_i^2\right] 
\]
!et
and we want to find $\beta$ such that $C(\beta)$ is minimized.

!split
===== The derivative of the cost/loss function =====

Computing $\partial C(\beta) / \partial \beta_0$ and $\partial C(\beta) / \partial \beta_1$ we can show  that the gradient can be written as
!bt
\[
\nabla_{\beta} C(\beta) = \frac{2}{n}\begin{bmatrix} \sum_{i=1}^{100} \left(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i-y_i\right) \\
\sum_{i=1}^{100}\left( x_i (\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)-y_ix_i\right) \\
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{2}{n}X^T(X\beta - \mathbf{y}), 
\]
!et
where $X$ is the design matrix defined above.

!split
===== The Hessian matrix =====
The Hessian matrix of $C(\beta)$ is given by 
!bt
\[
\bm{H} \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial^2 C(\beta)}{\partial \beta_0^2} & \frac{\partial^2 C(\beta)}{\partial \beta_0 \partial \beta_1}  \\
\frac{\partial^2 C(\beta)}{\partial \beta_0 \partial \beta_1} & \frac{\partial^2 C(\beta)}{\partial \beta_1^2} &  \\
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{2}{n}X^T X.
\]
!et
This result implies that $C(\beta)$ is a convex function since the matrix $X^T X$ always is positive semi-definite.




!split
===== Simple program =====

We can now write a program that minimizes $C(\beta)$ using the gradient descent method with a constant learning rate $\gamma$ according to 
!bt
\[
\beta_{k+1} = \beta_k - \gamma \nabla_\beta C(\beta_k), \ k=0,1,\cdots 
\]
!et

We can use the expression we computed for the gradient and let use a
$\beta_0$ be chosen randomly and let $\gamma = 0.001$. Stop iterating
when $||\nabla_\beta C(\beta_k) || \leq \epsilon = 10^{-8}$. _Note that the code below does not include the latter stop criterion_.

And finally we can compare our solution for $\beta$ with the analytic result given by 
$\beta= (X^TX)^{-1} X^T \mathbf{y}$.

===== Gradient descent and Ridge =====

We have also discussed Ridge regression where the loss function contains a regularized term given by the $L_2$ norm of $\beta$, 
!bt
\[
C_{\text{ridge}}(\beta) = \frac{1}{n}||X\beta -\mathbf{y}||^2 + \lambda ||\beta||^2, \ \lambda \geq 0.
\]
!et

In order to minimize $C_{\text{ridge}}(\beta)$ using GD we only have adjust the gradient as follows 
!bt
\[
\nabla_\beta C_{\text{ridge}}(\beta)  = \frac{2}{n}\begin{bmatrix} \sum_{i=1}^{100} \left(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i-y_i\right) \\
\sum_{i=1}^{100}\left( x_i (\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)-y_ix_i\right) \\
\end{bmatrix} + 2\lambda\begin{bmatrix} \beta_0 \\ \beta_1\end{bmatrix} = 2 (X^T(X\beta - \mathbf{y})+\lambda \beta).
\]
!et

We can easily extend our program to minimize $C_{\text{ridge}}(\beta)$ using gradient descent and compare with the analytical solution given by

\[

===== Using gradient descent methods, limitations =====

* _Gradient descent (GD) finds local minima of our function_. Since the GD algorithm is deterministic, if it converges, it will converge to a local minimum of our cost/loss/risk function. Because in ML we are often dealing with extremely rugged landscapes with many local minima, this can lead to poor performance.

* _GD is sensitive to initial conditions_. One consequence of the local nature of GD is that initial conditions matter. Depending on where one starts, one will end up at a different local minima. Therefore, it is very important to think about how one initializes the training process. This is true for GD as well as more complicated variants of GD.

* _Gradients are computationally expensive to calculate for large datasets_. In many cases in statistics and ML, the cost/loss/risk function is a sum of terms, with one term for each data point. For example, in linear regression, $E \propto \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \mathbf{w}^T\cdot\mathbf{x}_i)^2$; for logistic regression, the square error is replaced by the cross entropy. To calculate the gradient we have to sum over *all* $n$ data points. Doing this at every GD step becomes extremely computationally expensive. An ingenious solution to this, is to calculate the gradients using small subsets of the data called ``mini batches''. This has the added benefit of introducing stochasticity into our algorithm.

* _GD is very sensitive to choices of learning rates_. GD is extremely sensitive to the choice of learning rates. If the learning rate is very small, the training process take an extremely long time. For larger learning rates, GD can diverge and give poor results. Furthermore, depending on what the local landscape looks like, we have to modify the learning rates to ensure convergence. Ideally, we would *adaptively* choose the learning rates to match the landscape.

* _GD treats all directions in parameter space uniformly._ Another major drawback of GD is that unlike Newton's method, the learning rate for GD is the same in all directions in parameter space. For this reason, the maximum learning rate is set by the behavior of the steepest direction and this can significantly slow down training. Ideally, we would like to take large steps in flat directions and small steps in steep directions. Since we are exploring rugged landscapes where curvatures change, this requires us to keep track of not only the gradient but second derivatives. The ideal scenario would be to calculate the Hessian but this proves to be too computationally expensive. 
	
* GD can take exponential time to escape saddle points, even with random initialization. As we mentioned, GD is extremely sensitive to initial condition since it determines the particular local minimum GD would eventually reach. However, even with a good initialization scheme, through the introduction of randomness, GD can still take exponential time to escape saddle points.  This leads us to our next topic, Stochastic Gradient Methods.

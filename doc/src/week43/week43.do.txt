===== Convolutional Neural Networks (recognizing images) =====


Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed during the last
decade of the previous century, with a focus on character recognition
tasks. Nowadays, CNNs are a central element in the spectacular success
of deep learning methods. The success in for example image
classifications have made them a central tool for most machine
learning practitioners.

CNNs are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks.
They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and
biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and
optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still
expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image
pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a
loss function (for example Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer
and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural
Networks still apply (back propagation, gradient descent etc etc).

!split
===== What is the Difference =====

_CNN architectures make the explicit assumption that
the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties
into the architecture. These then make the forward function more
efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in
the network._

Here we provide only a superficial overview, for the more interested, we recommend highly the course
"IN5400 – Machine Learning for Image Analysis":"https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5400/index-eng.html"
and the slides of "CS231":"http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/".

Another good read is the article here URL:"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285.pdf". 




!split
===== Neural Networks vs CNNs =====

Neural networks are defined as _affine transformations_, that is 
a vector is received as input and is multiplied with a matrix of so-called weights (our unknown paramters) to produce an
output (to which a bias vector is usually added before passing the result
through a nonlinear activation function). This is applicable to any type of input, be it an
image, a sound clip or an unordered collection of features: whatever their
dimensionality, their representation can always be flattened into a vector
before the transformation.


!split
===== Why CNNS for images, sound files, medical images from CT scans etc? =====

However, when we consider images, sound clips and many other similar kinds of data, these data  have an intrinsic
structure. More formally, they share these important properties:
* They are stored as multi-dimensional arrays (think of the pixels of a figure) .
* They feature one or more axes for which ordering matters (e.g., width and height axes for an image, time axis for a sound clip).
* One axis, called the channel axis, is used to access different views of the data (e.g., the red, green and blue channels of a color image, or the left and right channels of a stereo audio track).

These properties are not exploited when an affine transformation is applied; in
fact, all the axes are treated in the same way and the topological information
is not taken into account. Still, taking advantage of the implicit structure of
the data may prove very handy in solving some tasks, like computer vision and
speech recognition, and in these cases it would be best to preserve it. This is
where discrete convolutions come into play.

A discrete convolution is a linear transformation that preserves this notion of
ordering. It is sparse (only a few input units contribute to a given output
unit) and reuses parameters (the same weights are applied to multiple locations
in the input).




!split
===== Regular NNs don’t scale well to full images =====

As an example, consider
an image of size $32\times 32\times 3$ (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a
single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular
Neural Network would have $32\times 32\times 3 = 3072$ weights. This amount still
seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not
scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable
size, say $200\times 200\times 3$, would lead to neurons that have 
$200\times 200\times 3 = 120,000$ weights. 

We could have
several such neurons, and the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly,
this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters
would quickly lead to possible overfitting.

!split
===== 3D volumes of neurons ===== 

Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the
input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more
sensible way. 

In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the
layers of a CNN have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width,
height, depth. (Note that the word depth here refers to the third
dimension of an activation volume, not to the depth of a full Neural
Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.)

To understand it better, the above example of an image 
with an input volume of
activations has dimensions $32\times 32\times 3$ (width, height,
depth respectively). 

The neurons in a layer will
only be connected to a small region of the layer before it, instead of
all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. Moreover, the final
output layer could  for this specific image have dimensions $1\times 1 \times 10$, 
because by the
end of the CNN architecture we will reduce the full image into a
single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth
dimension. 

FIGURE: [figslides/cnn.jpeg, width=500 frac=0.6]  A CNN arranges its neurons in three dimensions (width, height, depth), as visualized in one of the layers. Every layer of a CNN transforms the 3D input volume to a 3D output volume of neuron activations. In this example, the red input layer holds the image, so its width and height would be the dimensions of the image, and the depth would be 3 (Red, Green, Blue channels).



!split 
===== Layers used to build CNNs =====


A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN
transforms one volume of activations to another through a
differentiable function. We use three main types of layers to build
CNN architectures: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and
Fully-Connected Layer (exactly as seen in regular Neural Networks). We
will stack these layers to form a full CNN architecture.

A simple CNN for image classification could have the architecture:

* _INPUT_ ($32\times 32 \times 3$) will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.
* _CONV_ (convolutional )layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as $[32\times 32\times 12]$ if we decided to use 12 filters.
* _RELU_ layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the $max(0,x)$ thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged ($[32\times 32\times 12]$).
* _POOL_ (pooling) layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as $[16\times 16\times 12]$.
* _FC_ (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size $[1\times 1\times 10]$, where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of the MNIST images we considered above . As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume.


!split
===== Transforming images =====

CNNs transform the original image layer by layer from the original
pixel values to the final class scores. 

Observe that some layers contain
parameters and other don’t. In particular, the CNN layers perform
transformations that are a function of not only the activations in the
input volume, but also of the parameters (the weights and biases of
the neurons). On the other hand, the RELU/POOL layers will implement a
fixed function. The parameters in the CONV/FC layers will be trained
with gradient descent so that the class scores that the CNN computes
are consistent with the labels in the training set for each image.


!split
===== CNNs in brief =====

In summary:

* A CNN architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores)
* There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)
* Each Layer accepts an input 3D volume and transforms it to an output 3D volume through a differentiable function
* Each Layer may or may not have parameters (e.g. CONV/FC do, RELU/POOL don’t)
* Each Layer may or may not have additional hyperparameters (e.g. CONV/FC/POOL do, RELU doesn’t)

The textbook by Goodfellow et al, see chapter 9 contains an in depth discussion as well.

!split
===== Key Idea =====

A dense neural network is representd by an affine operation (like matrix-matrix multiplication) where all parameters are included.

The key idea in CNNs for say imaging is that in images neighbor pixels tend to be related! So we connect
only neighboring neurons in the input instead of connecting all with the first hidden layer.

We say we perform a filtering (convolution is the mathematical operation). 


!split
===== Mathematics of CNNs =====

The mathematics of CNNs is based on the mathematical operation of
_convolution_.  In mathematics (in particular in functional analysis),
convolution is represented by mathematical operation (integration,
summation etc) on two function in order to produce a third function
that expresses how the shape of one gets modified by the other.
Convolution has a plethora of applications in a variety of disciplines, spanning from statistics to signal processing, computer vision, solutions of differential equations,linear algebra, engineering,  and yes, machine learning.

Mathematically, convolution is defined as follows (one-dimensional example):
Let us define a continuous function $y(t)$ given by
!bt
\[
y(t) = \int x(a) w(t-a) da,
\]
!et
where $x(a)$ represents a so-called input and $w(t-a)$ is normally called the weight function or kernel.

The above integral is written in  a more compact form as
!bt
\[
y(t) = \left(x * w\right)(t).
\]
!et

The discretized version reads
!bt
\[
y(t) = \sum_{a=-\infty}^{a=\infty}x(a)w(t-a).
\]
!et
Computing the inverse of the above convolution operations is known as deconvolution.

How can we use this? And what does it mean? Let us study some familiar examples first.


!split
===== Convolution Examples: Polynomial multiplication =====

We have already met such an example in project 1 when we tried to set
up the design matrix for a two-dimensional function. This was an
example of polynomial multiplication.  Let us recast such a problem in terms of the convolution operation.
Let us look a the following polynomials to second and third order, respectively:
!bt
\[
p(t) = \alpha_0+\alpha_1 t+\alpha_2 t^2,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
s(t) = \beta_0+\beta_1 t+\beta_2 t^2+\beta_3 t^3.
\]
!et

The polynomial multiplication gives us a new polynomial of degree $5$
!bt
\[
z(t) = \delta_0+\delta_1 t+\delta_2 t^2+\delta_3 t^3+\delta_4 t^4+\delta_5 t^5.
\]
!et

!split
===== Efficient Polynomial Multiplication =====

Computing polynomial products can be implemented efficiently if we rewrite the more brute force multiplications using convolution.
We note first that the new coefficients are given as

!bt
\begin{split}
\delta_0=&\alpha_0\beta_0\\
\delta_1=&\alpha_1\beta_0+\alpha_0\beta_1\\
\delta_2=&\alpha_0\beta_2+\alpha_1\beta_1+\alpha_2\beta_0\\
\delta_3=&\alpha_1\beta_2+\alpha_2\beta_1+\alpha_0\beta_3\\
\delta_4=&\alpha_2\beta_2+\alpha_1\beta_3\\
\delta_5=&\alpha_2\beta_3.\\
\end{split}
!et


We note that $\alpha_i=0$ except for $i\in \left\{0,1,2\right\}$ and $\beta_i=0$ except for $i\in\left\{0,1,2,3\right\}$.

We can then rewrite the coefficients $\delta_j$ using a discrete convolution as
!bt
\[
\delta_j = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{i=\infty}\alpha_i\beta_{j-i}=(\alpha * \beta)_j,
\]
!et
or as a double sum with restriction $l=i+j$
!bt
\[
\delta_l = \sum_{ij}\alpha_i\beta_{j}.
\]
!et

Do you see a potential drawback with these equations?

!split
===== A more efficient way of coding the above Convolution =====

Since we only have a finite number of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values
which are non-zero, we can rewrite the above convolution expressions
as a matrix-vector multiplication

!bt
\[
\bm{\delta}=\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                            \alpha_1 & \alpha_0 & 0 & 0 \\
			    \alpha_2 & \alpha_1 & \alpha_0 & 0 \\
			    0 & \alpha_2 & \alpha_1 & \alpha_0 \\
			    0 & 0 & \alpha_2 & \alpha_1 \\
			    0 & 0 & 0 & \alpha_2
			    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \beta_0 \\ \beta_1 \\ \beta_2 \\ \beta_3\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

The process is commutative and we can easily see that we can rewrite the multiplication in terms of  a matrix holding $\beta$ and a vector holding $\alpha$.
In this case we have
!bt
\[
\bm{\delta}=\begin{bmatrix}\beta_0 & 0 & 0  \\
                            \beta_1 & \beta_0 & 0  \\
			    \beta_2 & \beta_1 & \beta_0  \\
			    \beta_3 & \beta_2 & \beta_1 \\
			    0 & \beta_3 & \beta_2 \\
			    0 & 0 & \beta_3
			    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_0 \\ \alpha_1 \\ \alpha_2\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

Note that the use of these  matrices is for mathematical purposes only  and not implementation purposes.
When implementing the above equation we do not encode (and allocate memory) the matrices explicitely.
We rather code the convolutions in the minimal memory footprint that they require.

Does the number of floating point operations change here when we use the commutative property?




!split
=====  Two-dimensional Objects =====

We often use convolutions over more than one dimension at a time. If
we have a two-dimensional image $I$ as input, we can have a _filter_
defined by a two-dimensional _kernel_ $K$. This leads to an output $S$

!bt
\[
S_(i,j)=(I * K)(i,j) = \sum_m\sum_n I(m,n)K(i-m,j-n).
\]
!et

Convolution is a commutatitave process, which means we can rewrite this equation as
!bt
\[
S_(i,j)=(I * K)(i,j) = \sum_m\sum_n I(i-m,j-n)K(m,n).
\]
!et

Normally the latter is more straightforward to implement in  a machine elarning library since there is less variation in the range of values of $m$ and $n$.

!split
===== Cross-Correlation =====



Many deep learning libraries implement cross-correlation instead of convolution
!bt
\[
S_(i,j)=(I * K)(i,j) = \sum_m\sum_n I(i+m,j-+)K(m,n).
\]
!et


!split
===== More on Dimensionalities =====

In feilds like signal processing (and imaging as well), one designs
so-called filters. These filters are defined by the convolutions and
are often hand-crafted. One may specify filters for smoothing, edge
detection, frequency reshaping, and similar operations. However with
neural networks the idea is to automatically learn the filters and use
many of them in conjunction with non-linear operations (activation
functions).

As an example consider a neural network operating on sound sequence
data.  Assume that we an input vector $\bm{x}$ of length $d=10^6$.  We
construct then a neural network with onle hidden layer only with
$10^4$ nodes. This means that we will have a weight matrix with
$10^4\times 10^6=10^{10}$ weights to be determined, together with $10^4$ biases.

Assume furthermore that we have an output layer which is meant to train whether the sound sequence represents a human voice (true) or something else (false).
It means that we have only one output node. But since this output node connects to $10^4$ nodes in the hidden layer, there are in total $10^4$ weights to be determined for the output layer, plus one bias. In total we have

!bt
\[
\mathrm{NumberParameters}=10^{10}+10^4+10^4+1 \approx 10^{10},
\]
!et
that is ten billion parameters to determine. 


!split
===== Further Dimensionality Remarks =====

In today’s architecture one can train such neural networks, however
this is a huge number of parameters for the task at hand. In general,
it is a very wasteful and inefficient use of dense matrices as
parameters. Just as importantly, such trained network parameters are
very specific for the type of input data on which they were trained
and the network is not likely to generalize easily to variations in
the input.


The main principles that justify convolutions is locality of
information and repetion of patterns within the signal. Sound samples
of the input in adjacent spots are much more likely to affect each
other than those that are very far away. Similarly, sounds are
repeated in multiple times in the signal. While slightly simplistic,
reasoning about such a sound example demonstrates this. The same
principles then apply to images and other similar data.


!split
===== CNNs in more detail, Lecture from IN5400 =====

* "Lectures from IN5400 spring 2019":"https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5400/v19/material/week5/in5400_2019_week5_convolutional_nerual_networks.pdf"


!split
===== CNNs in more detail, building convolutional neural networks in Tensorflow and Keras =====

  
As discussed above, CNNs are neural networks built from the assumption that the inputs
to the network are 2D images. This is important because the number of features or pixels in images
grows very fast with the image size, and an enormous number of weights and biases are needed in order to build an accurate network.  
  
As before, we still have our input, a hidden layer and an output. What's novel about convolutional networks
are the _convolutional_ and _pooling_ layers stacked in pairs between the input and the hidden layer.
In addition, the data is no longer represented as a 2D feature matrix, instead each input is a number of 2D
matrices, typically 1 for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue). 


!split
===== Setting it up =====

It means that to represent the entire
dataset of images, we require a 4D matrix or _tensor_. This tensor has the dimensions:  
!bt
\[  
(n_{inputs},\, n_{pixels, width},\, n_{pixels, height},\, depth) .
\]
!et
  
!split
=====  The MNIST dataset again =====

The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images with a pixel size of
$28\times 28$, meaning we require $28 \times 28 = 724$ weights to each
neuron in the first hidden layer.

If we were to analyze images of size $128\times 128$ we would require
$128 \times 128 = 16384$ weights to each neuron. Even worse if we were
dealing with color images, as most images are, we have an image matrix
of size $128\times 128$ for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue),
meaning 3 times the number of weights $= 49152$ are required for every
single neuron in the first hidden layer.
  

!split
===== Strong correlations =====

Images typically have strong local correlations, meaning that a small
part of the image varies little from its neighboring regions. If for
example we have an image of a blue car, we can roughly assume that a
small blue part of the image is surrounded by other blue regions.

Therefore, instead of connecting every single pixel to a neuron in the
first hidden layer, as we have previously done with deep neural
networks, we can instead connect each neuron to a small part of the
image (in all 3 RGB depth dimensions).  The size of each small area is
fixed, and known as a "receptive":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_field".
  

!split 
===== Layers of a CNN =====
The layers of a convolutional neural network arrange neurons in 3D: width, height and depth.  
The input image is typically a square matrix of depth 3. 

A _convolution_ is performed on the image which outputs
a 3D volume of neurons. The weights to the input are arranged in a number of 2D matrices, known as _filters_.


Each filter slides along the input image, taking the dot product
between each small part of the image and the filter, in all depth
dimensions. This is then passed through a non-linear function,
typically the _Rectified Linear (ReLu)_ function, which serves as the
activation of the neurons in the first convolutional layer. This is
further passed through a _pooling layer_, which reduces the size of the
convolutional layer, e.g. by taking the maximum or average across some
small regions, and this serves as input to the next convolutional
layer.


!split
===== Systematic reduction =====  

By systematically reducing the size of the input volume, through
convolution and pooling, the network should create representations of
small parts of the input, and then from them assemble representations
of larger areas.  The final pooling layer is flattened to serve as
input to a hidden layer, such that each neuron in the final pooling
layer is connected to every single neuron in the hidden layer. This
then serves as input to the output layer, e.g. a softmax output for
classification.

===== Set up  the model =====

The 6 lines of code below define the convolutional base using a common pattern: a stack of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers.

As input, a CNN takes tensors of shape (image_height, image_width, color_channels), ignoring the batch size. If you are new to these dimensions, color_channels refers to (R,G,B). In this example, you will configure our CNN to process inputs of shape (32, 32, 3), which is the format of CIFAR images. You can do this by passing the argument input_shape to our first layer.

!bc pycod
model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))

# Let's display the architecture of our model so far.

model.summary()
!ec

You can see that the output of every Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layer is a 3D tensor of shape (height, width, channels). The width and height dimensions tend to shrink as you go deeper in the network. The number of output channels for each Conv2D layer is controlled by the first argument (e.g., 32 or 64). Typically, as the width and height shrink, you can afford (computationally) to add more output channels in each Conv2D layer.




!split
===== Add Dense layers on top =====

To complete our model, you will feed the last output tensor from the
convolutional base (of shape (4, 4, 64)) into one or more Dense layers
to perform classification. Dense layers take vectors as input (which
are 1D), while the current output is a 3D tensor. First, you will
flatten (or unroll) the 3D output to 1D, then add one or more Dense
layers on top. CIFAR has 10 output classes, so you use a final Dense
layer with 10 outputs and a softmax activation.

!bc pycod
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10))
#Here's the complete architecture of our model.
model.summary()

As you can see, our (4, 4, 64) outputs were flattened into vectors of shape (1024) before going through two dense layers.

===== Recurrent neural networks: Overarching view =====

Till now our focus has been, including convolutional neural networks
as well, on feedforward neural networks. The output or the activations
flow only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) looks very much like a feedforward
neural network, except that it also has connections pointing
backward. 

RNNs are used to analyze time series data such as stock prices, and
tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems, they can
anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally,
they can work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on
fixed-sized inputs like all the nets we have discussed so far. For
example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio samples as
input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing
systems such as automatic translation and speech-to-text.

===== Formatting the Data =====

The way the recurrent neural networks are trained in this program
differs from how machine learning algorithms are usually trained.
Typically a machine learning algorithm is trained by learning the
relationship between the x data and the y data.  In this program, the
recurrent neural network will be trained to recognize the relationship
in a sequence of y values.  This is type of data formatting is
typically used time series forcasting, but it can also be used in any
extrapolation (time series forecasting is just a specific type of
extrapolation along the time axis).  This method of data formatting
does not use the x data and assumes that the y data are evenly spaced.

For a standard machine learning algorithm, the training data has the
form of (x,y) so the machine learning algorithm learns to assiciate a
y value with a given x value.  This is useful when the test data has x
values within the same range as the training data.  However, for this
application, the x values of the test data are outside of the x values
of the training data and the traditional method of training a machine
learning algorithm does not work as well.  For this reason, the
recurrent neural network is trained on sequences of y values of the
form ((y1, y2), y3), so that the network is concerned with learning
the pattern of the y data and not the relation between the x and y
data.  As long as the pattern of y data outside of the training region
stays relatively stable compared to what was inside the training
region, this method of training can produce accurate extrapolations to
y values far removed from the training data set.


# 
# The idea behind formatting the data in this way comes from [this resource](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) and [this one](https://fairyonice.github.io/Understand-Keras%27s-RNN-behind-the-scenes-with-a-sin-wave-example.html).
# 
# The following method takes in a y data set and formats it so the "x data" are of the form (y1, y2) and the "y data" are of the form y3, with extra brackets added in to make the resulting arrays compatable with both Keras and Tensorflow.
# 
# Note: Using a sequence length of two is not required for time series forecasting so any lenght of sequence could be used (for example instead of ((y1, y2) y3) you could change the length of sequence to be 4 and the resulting data points would have the form ((y1, y2, y3, y4), y5)).  While the following method can be used to create a data set of any sequence length, the remainder of the code expects the length of sequence to be 2.  This is because the data sets are very small and the higher the lenght of the sequence the less resulting data points.

===== Other Things to Try =====


Changing the size of the recurrent neural network and its parameters
can drastically change the results you get from the model.  The below
code takes the simple recurrent neural network from above and adds a
second hidden layer, changes the number of neurons in the hidden
layer, and explicitly declares the activation function of the hidden
layers to be a sigmoid function.  The loss function and optimizer can
also be changed but are kept the same as the above network.  These
parameters can be tuned to provide the optimal result from the
network.  For some ideas on how to improve the performance of a

===== Other Types of Recurrent Neural Networks =====

Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b"
and URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b".

The first network created below is similar to the previous network,
but it replaces the SimpleRNN layers with LSTM layers.  The second
network below has two hidden layers made up of GRUs, which are
preceeded by two dense (feeddorward) neural network layers.  These
dense layers "preprocess" the data before it reaches the recurrent
layers.  This architecture has been shown to improve the performance
of recurrent neural networks (see the link above and also
URL:"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02857.pdf".

===== Generative Models =====

_Generative models_ describe a class of statistical models that are a contrast
to _discriminative models_. Informally we say that generative models can
generate new data instances while discriminative models discriminate between
different kinds of data instances. A generative model could generate new photos
of animals that look like 'real' animals while a discriminative model could tell
a dog from a cat. More formally, given a data set $x$ and a set of labels /
targets $y$. Generative models capture the joint probability $p(x, y)$, or
just $p(x)$ if there are no labels, while discriminative models capture the
conditional probability $p(y | x)$. Discriminative models generally try to draw
boundaries in the data space (often high dimensional), while generative models
try to model how data is placed throughout the space.

_Note_: this material is thanks to Linus Ekstrøm. 

!split
===== Generative Adversarial Networks =====

_Generative Adversarial Networks_ are a type of unsupervised machine learning
algorithm proposed by "Goodfellow et. al": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf"
in 2014 (short and good article).

The simplest formulation of
the model is based on a game theoretic approach, *zero sum game*, where we pit
two neural networks against one another. We define two rival networks, one
generator $g$, and one discriminator $d$. The generator directly produces
samples
!bt
\begin{equation}
    x = g(z; \theta^{(g)})
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Discriminator =====
The discriminator attempts to distinguish between samples drawn from the
training data and samples drawn from the generator. In other words, it tries to
tell the difference between the fake data produced by $g$ and the actual data
samples we want to do prediction on. The discriminator outputs a probability
value given by

!bt
\begin{equation}
    d(x; \theta^{(d)})
\end{equation}
!et

indicating the probability that $x$ is a real training example rather than a
fake sample the generator has generated. The simplest way to formulate the
learning process in a generative adversarial network is a zero-sum game, in
which a function

!bt
\begin{equation}
    v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)})
\end{equation}
!et

determines the reward for the discriminator, while the generator gets the
conjugate reward

!bt
\begin{equation}
    -v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)})
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Learning Process =====

During learning both of the networks maximize their own reward function, so that
the generator gets better and better at tricking the discriminator, while the
discriminator gets better and better at telling the difference between the fake
and real data. The generator and discriminator alternate on which one trains at
one time (i.e. for one epoch). In other words, we keep the generator constant
and train the discriminator, then we keep the discriminator constant to train
the generator and repeat. It is this back and forth dynamic which lets GANs
tackle otherwise intractable generative problems. As the generator improves with
 training, the discriminator's performance gets worse because it cannot easily
 tell the difference between real and fake. If the generator ends up succeeding
 perfectly, the the discriminator will do no better than random guessing i.e.
 50\%. This progression in the training poses a problem for the convergence
 criteria for GANs. The discriminator feedback gets less meaningful over time,
 if we continue training after this point then the generator is effectively
 training on junk data which can undo the learning up to that point. Therefore,
 we stop training when the discriminator starts outputting $1/2$ everywhere.


!split
===== More about the Learning Process =====

At convergence we have

!bt
\begin{equation}
    g^* = \underset{g}{\mathrm{argmin}}\hspace{2pt}
          \underset{d}{\mathrm{max}}v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)})
\end{equation}
!et
The default choice for $v$ is
!bt
\begin{equation}
    v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)}) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_\mathrm{data}}\log d(x)
                                  + \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_\mathrm{model}}
                                  \log (1 - d(x))
\end{equation}
!et
The main motivation for the design of GANs is that the learning process requires
neither approximate inference (variational autoencoders for example) nor
approximation of a partition function. In the case where
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \underset{d}{\mathrm{max}}v(\theta^{(g)}, \theta^{(d)})
\end{equation}
!et
is convex in $\theta^{(g)} then the procedure is guaranteed to converge and is
asymptotically consistent
( "Seth Lloyd on QuGANs": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09139.pdf"  ).

!split
===== Additional References =====
This is in
general not the case and it is possible to get situations where the training
process never converges because the generator and discriminator chase one
another around in the parameter space indefinitely. A much deeper discussion on
the currently open research problem of GAN convergence is available
"here": "https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/generative_models.html". To
anyone interested in learning more about GANs it is a highly recommended read.
Direct quote: "In this best-performing formulation, the generator aims to
increase the log probability that the discriminator makes a mistake, rather than
aiming to decrease the log probability that the discriminator makes the correct
prediction." "Another interesting read": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160"

===== Writing Our First Generative Adversarial Network =====
Let us now move on to actually implementing a GAN in tensorflow. We will study
the performance of our GAN on the MNIST dataset. This code is based on and
adapted from the
"google tutorial": "https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan"

First we import our libraries

!bc pycod
import os
import time
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model
!ec

Next we define our hyperparameters and import our data the usual way

!bc pycod
BUFFER_SIZE = 60000
BATCH_SIZE = 256
EPOCHS = 30

data = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = data
train_images = np.reshape(train_images, (train_images.shape[0],
                                         28,
                                         28,
                                         1)).astype('float32')

# we normalize between -1 and 1
train_images = (train_images - 127.5) / 127.5
training_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
                      train_images).shuffle(BUFFER_SIZE).batch(BATCH_SIZE)
!ec

!split
===== MNIST and GANs =====

Let's have a quick look

!bc pycod
plt.imshow(train_images[0], cmap='Greys')
plt.show()
!ec

Now we define our two models. This is where the 'magic' happens. There are a
huge amount of possible formulations for both models. A lot of engineering and
trial and error can be done here to try to produce better performing models. For
more advanced GANs this is by far the step where you can 'make or break' a
model.

We start with the generator. As stated in the introductory text the generator
$g$ upsamples from a random sample to the shape of what we want to predict. In
our case we are trying to predict MNIST images ($28\times 28$ pixels).

!bc pycod
def generator_model():
    """

    assert model.output_shape == (None, 28, 28, 1)

    return model

!ec

And there we have our 'simple' generator model. Now we move on to defining our
discriminator model $d$, which is a convolutional neural network based image
classifier.

!bc pycod
def discriminator_model():
    """
    The discriminator is a convolutional neural network based image classifier

    # we define our model

    # adding a dropout layer as you do in conv-nets
    model.add(layers.Dropout(0.3))

    # adding a dropout layer as you do in conv-nets

    model.add(layers.Flatten())
    model.add(layers.Dense(1))

    return model

!split
===== Other Models =====
Let us take a look at our models. _Note_: double click images for bigger view.

!bc pycod
generator = generator_model()
plot_model(generator, show_shapes=True, rankdir='LR')
!ec

!bc pycod
discriminator = discriminator_model()
plot_model(discriminator, show_shapes=True, rankdir='LR')
!ec

Next we need a few helper objects we will use in training

!bc pycod
cross_entropy = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
generator_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-4)
discriminator_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-4)
!ec

The first object, *cross_entropy* is our loss function and the two others are
our optimizers. Notice we use the same learning rate for both $g$ and $d$. This
is because they need to improve their accuracy at approximately equal speeds to
get convergence (not necessarily exactly equal). Now we define our loss
functions

!bc pycod
def generator_loss(fake_output):
    loss = cross_entropy(tf.ones_like(fake_output), fake_output)

    return loss
!ec

!bc pycod
def discriminator_loss(real_output, fake_output):
    real_loss = cross_entropy(tf.ones_like(real_output), real_output)
    fake_loss = cross_entropy(tf.zeros_liks(fake_output), fake_output)
    total_loss = real_loss + fake_loss

    return total_loss
!ec

Next we define a kind of seed to help us compare the learning process over
multiple training epochs.

!bc pycod
noise_dimension = 100
n_examples_to_generate = 16
seed_images = tf.random.normal([n_examples_to_generate, noise_dimension])

===== Training Step =====

Now we have everything we need to define our training step, which we will apply
for every step in our training loop. Notice the @tf.function flag signifying
that the function is tensorflow 'compiled'. Removing this flag doubles the
computation time.

!bc pycod
@tf.function
def train_step(images):
    noise = tf.random.normal([BATCH_SIZE, noise_dimension])

    with tf.GradientTape() as gen_tape, tf.GradientTape() as disc_tape:
        generated_images = generator(noise, training=True)

        real_output = discriminator(images, training=True)
        fake_output = discriminator(generated_images, training=True)

        gen_loss = generator_loss(fake_output)
        disc_loss = discriminator_loss(real_output, fake_output)

    gradients_of_generator = gen_tape.gradient(gen_loss,
                                            generator.trainable_variables)
    gradients_of_discriminator = disc_tape.gradient(disc_loss,
                                            discriminator.trainable_variables)
    generator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_of_generator,
                                            generator.trainable_variables))
    discriminator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_of_discriminator,
                                            discriminator.trainable_variables))

    return gen_loss, disc_loss
!ec


Next we define a helper function to produce an output over our training epochs
to see the predictive progression of our generator model. _Note_: I am including
this code here, but comment it out in the training loop.
!bc pycod
def generate_and_save_images(model, epoch, test_input):
    # we're making inferences here
    predictions = model(test_input, training=False)

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))

    for i in range(predictions.shape[0]):
        plt.subplot(4, 4, i+1)
        plt.imshow(predictions[i, :, :, 0] * 127.5 + 127.5, cmap='gray')
        plt.axis('off')

    plt.savefig(f'./images_from_seed_images/image_at_epoch_{str(epoch).zfill(3)}.png')
    plt.close()
    #plt.show()
!ec


!split
===== Checkpoints =====
Setting up checkpoints to periodically save our model during training so that
everything is not lost even if the program were to somehow terminate while
training.

!bc pycod
# Setting up checkpoints to save model during training
checkpoint_dir = './training_checkpoints'
checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'ckpt')
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(generator_optimizer=generator_optimizer,
                            discriminator_optimizer=discriminator_optimizer,
                            generator=generator,
                            discriminator=discriminator)
!ec

Now we define our training loop

!bc pycod
def train(dataset, epochs):
    generator_loss_list = []
    discriminator_loss_list = []

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        start = time.time()

        for image_batch in dataset:
            gen_loss, disc_loss = train_step(image_batch)
            generator_loss_list.append(gen_loss.numpy())
            discriminator_loss_list.append(disc_loss.numpy())

        #generate_and_save_images(generator, epoch + 1, seed_images)

        if (epoch + 1) % 15 == 0:
            checkpoint.save(file_prefix=checkpoint_prefix)

        print(f'Time for epoch {epoch} is {time.time() - start}')

    #generate_and_save_images(generator, epochs, seed_images)

    loss_file = './data/lossfile.txt'
    with open(loss_file, 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write(str(generator_loss_list))
        outfile.write('\n')
        outfile.write('\n')
        outfile.write(str(discriminator_loss_list))
        outfile.write('\n')
        outfile.write('\n')
!ec


To train simply call this function. _Warning_: this might take a long time so
there is a folder of a pretrained network already included in the repository.

!bc pycod
train(train_dataset, EPOCHS)
!ec

And here is the result of training our model for 100 epochs

MOVIE: [images_from_seed_images/generation.gif]

Now to avoid having to train and everything, which will take a while depending
on your computer setup we now load in the model which produced the above gif.

!bc pycod
checkpoint.restore(tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir))
restored_generator = checkpoint.generator
restored_discriminator = checkpoint.discriminator

print(restored_generator)
print(restored_discriminator)
!ec


!split
===== Exploring the Latent Space =====

We have successfully loaded in our latest model. Let us now play around a bit
and see what kind of things we can learn about this model. Our generator takes
an array of 100 numbers. One idea can be to try to systematically change our
input. Let us try and see what we get

!bc pycod
def generate_latent_points(number=100, scale_means=1, scale_stds=1):
    latent_dim = 100
    means = scale_means * tf.linspace(-1, 1, num=latent_dim)
    stds = scale_stds * tf.linspace(-1, 1, num=latent_dim)
    latent_space_value_range = tf.random.normal([number, latent_dim],
                                                means,
                                                stds,
                                                dtype=tf.float64)

    return latent_space_value_range

def generate_images(latent_points):
    # notice we set training to false because we are making inferences
    generated_images = restored_generator.predict(latent_points)

    return generated_images
!ec

!bc pycod
def plot_result(generated_images, number=100):
    # obviously this assumes sqrt number is an int
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(int(np.sqrt(number)), int(np.sqrt(number)),
                            figsize=(10, 10))

    for i in range(int(np.sqrt(number))):
        for j in range(int(np.sqrt(number))):
            axs[i, j].imshow(generated_images[i*j], cmap='Greys')
            axs[i, j].axis('off')

    plt.show()
!ec

!bc pycod
generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points())
plot_result(generated_images)
!ec

!split
===== Getting Results =====
We see that the generator generates images that look like MNIST
numbers: $1, 4, 7, 9$. Let's try to tweak it a bit more to see if we are able
to generate a similar plot where we generate every MNIST number. Let us now try
to 'move' a bit around in the latent space. _Note_: decrease the plot number if
these following cells take too long to run on your computer.

!bc pycod
plot_number = 225

generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points(number=plot_number,
                                                          scale_means=5,
                                                          scale_stds=1))
plot_result(generated_images, number=plot_number)

generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points(number=plot_number,
                                                          scale_means=-5,
                                                          scale_stds=1))
plot_result(generated_images, number=plot_number)

generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points(number=plot_number,
                                                          scale_means=1,
                                                          scale_stds=5))
plot_result(generated_images, number=plot_number)
!ec

Again, we have found something interesting. *Moving* around using our means
takes us from digit to digit, while *moving* around using our standard
deviations seem to increase the number of different digits! In the last image
above, we can barely make out every MNIST digit. Let us make on last plot using
this information by upping the standard deviation of our Gaussian noises.

!bc pycod
plot_number = 400
generated_images = generate_images(generate_latent_points(number=plot_number,
                                                          scale_means=1,
                                                          scale_stds=10))
plot_result(generated_images, number=plot_number)
!ec
A pretty cool result! We see that our generator indeed has learned a
distribution which qualitatively looks a whole lot like the MNIST dataset.

!split
===== Interpolating Between MNIST Digits =====
Another interesting way to explore the latent space of our generator model is by
interpolating between the MNIST digits. This section is largely based on
"this excellent blogpost": "https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-interpolate-and-perform-vector-arithmetic-with-faces-using-a-generative-adversarial-network/"
by Jason Brownlee.

So let us start by defining a function to interpolate between two points in the
latent space.

!bc pycod
def interpolation(point_1, point_2, n_steps=10):
    ratios = np.linspace(0, 1, num=n_steps)
    vectors = []
    for i, ratio in enumerate(ratios):
        vectors.append(((1.0 - ratio) * point_1 + ratio * point_2))

    return tf.stack(vectors)
!ec

Now we have all we need to do our interpolation analysis.

!bc pycod
plot_number = 100
latent_points = generate_latent_points(number=plot_number)
results = None
for i in range(0, 2*np.sqrt(plot_number), 2):
    interpolated = interpolation(latent_points[i], latent_points[i+1])
    generated_images = generate_images(interpolated)

    if results is None:
        results = generated_images
    else:
        results = tf.stack((results, generated_images))

plot_results(results, plot_number)
!ec

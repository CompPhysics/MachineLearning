===== Lectures and ComputerLab =====

!bblock
  * Lectures: Thursday (12.15pm-2pm) and Friday (12.15pm-2pm).
  * Weekly reading assignments needed to solve projects.
  * First hour of each lab session may be used to discuss technicalities, address questions etc linked with projects.
  * Detailed lecture notes, exercises, all programs presented, projects etc can be found at the homepage of the course.
  * Computerlab: Wednesday (10am-6pm), room FV329, four groups (10am-12pm, 12pm-2pm, 2pm-4pm, 4pm-6pm). 
  * Weekly plans and all other information are on the official webpage.
  * No final exam, three projects that are graded and have to be approved.

===== Course Format =====

!bblock
  * Three compulsory projects. Electronic reports only using "devilry":"https://devilry.ifi.uio.no/" to hand in projects and "Git":"https://github.com/" for repository and all your material.
  * Evaluation and grading: The three projects are graded and each counts 1/3 of the final mark. No final written or oral exam.
  * The last project is organized as a workshop (duration approx 5-6 hours toward the end of the semester) where each group submits a proposal for a data sets to be analyzed with the different methods discussed during the course. 
    o Each group submits a proposal or works with suggested (by us) proposals for the project.
    o Each group makes a poster and presents this to all other participants of the course
    o Poster session where all participants can study and discuss the other proposals (the three best posters get additional score)
    o Based on feedback etc, each group finalizes the report and submits for grading. 
  * The computer lab (room FV329)consists of 16 Linux PCs, but many prefer own laptops. Python is the default programming language, but feel free to use C/C++ and/or Fortran. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and "github address":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning/tree/master/doc/Programs" of the course.

===== Learning outcomes =====

!bblock
The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods essential for studies of data analysis and machine learning. The course is project based and through the various projects, normally three, you will be exposed to fundamental research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific results. You will learn to develop and structure large codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course. More specifically, after this course you will

* Learn about basic data analysis, Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods, data optimization and machine learning;
* Be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases;
* Have an understanding of central algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning;
* Gain knowledge of central aspects of Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, Gibbs samplers and their possible applications, from numerical integration to simulation of stock markets;
* Understand linear methods for regression and classification;
* Learn about neural network, genetic algorithms and Boltzmann machines;
* Work on numerical projects to illustrate the theory. The projects play a central role and you are expected to know modern programming languages like Python or C++.

===== Convolutional Neural Networks (recognizing images) =====


Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed during the last
decade of the previous century, with a focus on character recognition
tasks. Nowadays, CNNs are a central element in the spectacular success
of deep learning methods. The success in for example image
classifications have made them a central tool for most machine
learning practitioners.

CNNs are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks.
They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and
biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and
optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still
expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image
pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a
loss function (for example Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer
and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural
Networks still apply (back propagation, gradient descent etc etc).

!split
===== What is the Difference =====

_CNN architectures make the explicit assumption that
the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties
into the architecture. These then make the forward function more
efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in
the network._



!split
===== Neural Networks vs CNNs =====

Neural networks are defined as _affine transformations_, that is 
a vector is received as input and is multiplied with a matrix of so-called weights (our unknown paramters) to produce an
output (to which a bias vector is usually added before passing the result
through a nonlinear activation function). This is applicable to any type of input, be it an
image, a sound clip or an unordered collection of features: whatever their
dimensionality, their representation can always be flattened into a vector
before the transformation.


!split
===== Why CNNS for images, sound files, medical images from CT scans etc? =====

However, when we consider images, sound clips and many other similar kinds of data, these data  have an intrinsic
structure. More formally, they share these important properties:
* They are stored as multi-dimensional arrays (think of the pixels of a figure) .
* They feature one or more axes for which ordering matters (e.g., width and height axes for an image, time axis for a sound clip).
* One axis, called the channel axis, is used to access different views of the data (e.g., the red, green and blue channels of a color image, or the left and right channels of a stereo audio track).

These properties are not exploited when an affine transformation is applied; in
fact, all the axes are treated in the same way and the topological information
is not taken into account. Still, taking advantage of the implicit structure of
the data may prove very handy in solving some tasks, like computer vision and
speech recognition, and in these cases it would be best to preserve it. This is
where discrete convolutions come into play.

A discrete convolution is a linear transformation that preserves this notion of
ordering. It is sparse (only a few input units contribute to a given output
unit) and reuses parameters (the same weights are applied to multiple locations
in the input).




!split
===== Regular NNs don’t scale well to full images =====

As an example, consider
an image of size $32\times 32\times 3$ (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a
single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular
Neural Network would have $32\times 32\times 3 = 3072$ weights. This amount still
seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not
scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable
size, say $200\times 200\times 3$, would lead to neurons that have 
$200\times 200\times 3 = 120,000$ weights. 

We could have
several such neurons, and the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly,
this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters
would quickly lead to possible overfitting.

!split
===== 3D volumes of neurons ===== 

Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the
input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more
sensible way. 

In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the
layers of a CNN have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width,
height, depth. (Note that the word depth here refers to the third
dimension of an activation volume, not to the depth of a full Neural
Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.)

To understand it better, the above example of an image 
with an input volume of
activations has dimensions $32\times 32\times 3$ (width, height,
depth respectively). 

The neurons in a layer will
only be connected to a small region of the layer before it, instead of
all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. Moreover, the final
output layer could  for this specific image have dimensions $1\times 1 \times 10$, 
because by the
end of the CNN architecture we will reduce the full image into a
single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth
dimension. 

FIGURE: [figslides/cnn.jpeg, width=500 frac=0.6]  A CNN arranges its neurons in three dimensions (width, height, depth), as visualized in one of the layers. Every layer of a CNN transforms the 3D input volume to a 3D output volume of neuron activations. In this example, the red input layer holds the image, so its width and height would be the dimensions of the image, and the depth would be 3 (Red, Green, Blue channels).




!split 
===== Layers used to build CNNs =====


A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN
transforms one volume of activations to another through a
differentiable function. We use three main types of layers to build
CNN architectures: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and
Fully-Connected Layer (exactly as seen in regular Neural Networks). We
will stack these layers to form a full CNN architecture.

A simple CNN for image classification could have the architecture:

* _INPUT_ ($32\times 32 \times 3$) will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.
* _CONV_ (convolutional )layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as $[32\times 32\times 12]$ if we decided to use 12 filters.
* _RELU_ layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the $max(0,x)$ thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged ($[32\times 32\times 12]$).
* _POOL_ (pooling) layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as $[16\times 16\times 12]$.
* _FC_ (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size $[1\times 1\times 10]$, where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of the MNIST images we considered above . As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume.





!split
===== CNNs in brief =====

In summary:

* A CNN architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores)
* There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)
* Each Layer accepts an input 3D volume and transforms it to an output 3D volume through a differentiable function
* Each Layer may or may not have parameters (e.g. CONV/FC do, RELU/POOL don’t)
* Each Layer may or may not have additional hyperparameters (e.g. CONV/FC/POOL do, RELU doesn’t)

!split
===== Key Idea =====

A dense neural network is representd by an affine operation (like matrix-matrix multiplication) where all parameters are included.

The key idea in CNNs for say imaging is that in images neighbor pixels tend to be related! So we connect
only neighboring neurons in the input instead of connecting all with the first hidden layer.

We say we perform a filtering (convolution is the mathematical operation). 




!split
===== Building convolutional neural networks in Tensorflow and Keras =====

  
As discussed above, CNNs are neural networks built from the assumption that the inputs
to the network are 2D images. This is important because the number of features or pixels in images
grows very fast with the image size, and an enormous number of weights and biases are needed in order to build an accurate network.  
  
As before, we still have our input, a hidden layer and an output. What's novel about convolutional networks
are the _convolutional_ and _pooling_ layers stacked in pairs between the input and the hidden layer.
In addition, the data is no longer represented as a 2D feature matrix, instead each input is a number of 2D
matrices, typically 1 for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue). 


!split
===== Setting it up =====

It means that to represent the entire
dataset of images, we require a 4D matrix or _tensor_. This tensor has the dimensions:  
!bt
\[  
(n_{inputs},\, n_{pixels, width},\, n_{pixels, height},\, depth) .
\]
!et
  
!split
=====  The MNIST dataset again =====

The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images with a pixel size of
$28\times 28$, meaning we require $28 \times 28 = 724$ weights to each
neuron in the first hidden layer.

If we were to analyze images of size $128\times 128$ we would require
$128 \times 128 = 16384$ weights to each neuron. Even worse if we were
dealing with color images, as most images are, we have an image matrix
of size $128\times 128$ for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue),
meaning 3 times the number of weights $= 49152$ are required for every
single neuron in the first hidden layer.
  

!split
===== Strong correlations =====

Images typically have strong local correlations, meaning that a small
part of the image varies little from its neighboring regions. If for
example we have an image of a blue car, we can roughly assume that a
small blue part of the image is surrounded by other blue regions.

Therefore, instead of connecting every single pixel to a neuron in the
first hidden layer, as we have previously done with deep neural
networks, we can instead connect each neuron to a small part of the
image (in all 3 RGB depth dimensions).  The size of each small area is
fixed, and known as a "receptive":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_field".
  

!split 
===== Layers of a CNN =====

The layers of a convolutional neural network arrange neurons in 3D: width, height and depth.  
The input image is typically a square matrix of depth 3. 

A _convolution_ is performed on the image which outputs
a 3D volume of neurons. The weights to the input are arranged in a number of 2D matrices, known as _filters_.


Each filter slides along the input image, taking the dot product
between each small part of the image and the filter, in all depth
dimensions. This is then passed through a non-linear function,
typically the _Rectified Linear (ReLu)_ function, which serves as the
activation of the neurons in the first convolutional layer. This is
further passed through a _pooling layer_, which reduces the size of the
convolutional layer, e.g. by taking the maximum or average across some
small regions, and this serves as input to the next convolutional
layer.


!split
===== Systematic reduction =====  

By systematically reducing the size of the input volume, through
convolution and pooling, the network should create representations of
small parts of the input, and then from them assemble representations
of larger areas.  The final pooling layer is flattened to serve as
input to a hidden layer, such that each neuron in the final pooling
layer is connected to every single neuron in the hidden layer. This
then serves as input to the output layer, e.g. a softmax output for
classification.

               'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']

    # which is why you need the extra index
    plt.xlabel(class_names[train_labels[i][0]])
plt.show()
!ec

!split
===== Set up  the model =====

The 6 lines of code below define the convolutional base using a common pattern: a stack of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers.

As input, a CNN takes tensors of shape (image_height, image_width, color_channels), ignoring the batch size. If you are new to these dimensions, color_channels refers to (R,G,B). In this example, you will configure our CNN to process inputs of shape (32, 32, 3), which is the format of CIFAR images. You can do this by passing the argument input_shape to our first layer.

!bc pycod
model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))

# Let's display the architecture of our model so far.

model.summary()
!ec

You can see that the output of every Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layer is a 3D tensor of shape (height, width, channels). The width and height dimensions tend to shrink as you go deeper in the network. The number of output channels for each Conv2D layer is controlled by the first argument (e.g., 32 or 64). Typically, as the width and height shrink, you can afford (computationally) to add more output channels in each Conv2D layer.




!split
===== Add Dense layers on top =====

To complete our model, you will feed the last output tensor from the
convolutional base (of shape (4, 4, 64)) into one or more Dense layers
to perform classification. Dense layers take vectors as input (which
are 1D), while the current output is a 3D tensor. First, you will
flatten (or unroll) the 3D output to 1D, then add one or more Dense
layers on top. CIFAR has 10 output classes, so you use a final Dense
layer with 10 outputs and a softmax activation.

!bc pycod
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10))
# Here's the complete architecture of our model

model.summary()
!ec
As you can see, our (4, 4, 64) outputs were flattened into vectors of shape (1024) before going through two Dense layers.

===== Compile and train the model =====

===== Building our own CNN code ===== 


Here we present a flexible and readable python code for a CNN
implemented with NumPy. We will present the code, showcase how to use
the codebase and fit a CNN that yields a 99% accuracy on the 28x28
MNIST dataset within reasonable time.

_The codes here were developed by Eric Reber and Gregor Kajda during spring 2023._

The CNN is compatible with all schedulers, cost functions and
activation functions discussed in constructing our neural network
codes.
 
 The CNN code consists of different types of Layer classes, including
Convolution2DLayer, Pooling2DLayer, FlattenLayer, FullyConnectedLayer
and OutputLayer, which can be added to the CNN object using the
interface of the CNN class. This allows you to easily construct your
own CNN, as well as allowing you to get used to an interface similar
to that of TensorFlow which is used for real world applications. 

Another important feature of this code is that it throws errors if
unreasonable decisions are made (for example using a kernel that is
larger than the image, not using a FlattenLayer, etc), and provides
the user with an informative error message.

=== Schedulers ===

The code below shows object oriented implementations of the Constant,
Momentum, Adagrad, AdagradMomentum, RMS prop and Adam schedulers. All
of the classes belong to the shared abstract Scheduler class, and
share the update_change() and reset() methods allowing for any of the
schedulers to be seamlessly used during the training stage, as will
later be shown in the fit() method of the neural
network. Update_change() only has one parameter, the gradient
($\delta^{l}_{j}a^{l-1}_k$), and returns the change which will be
subtracted from the weights. The reset() function takes no parameters,
and resets the desired variables. For Constant and Momentum, reset
does nothing.

=== Usage of schedulers ===

To initalize a scheduler, simply create the object and pass in the necessary parameters such as the learning rate and the momentum as shown below. As the Scheduler class is an abstract class it should not called directly, and will raise an error upon usage.

!bc pycod
momentum_scheduler = Momentum(eta=1e-3, momentum=0.9)
adam_scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-3, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
!ec

Here is a small example for how a segment of code using schedulers could look. Switching out the schedulers is simple.

!bc pycod
weights = np.ones((3,3))
print(f"Before scheduler:\n{weights=}")

epochs = 10
for e in range(epochs):
    gradient = np.random.rand(3, 3)
    change = adam_scheduler.update_change(gradient)
    weights = weights - change
    adam_scheduler.reset()

print(f"\nAfter scheduler:\n{weights=}")
!ec

=== Cost functions ===

In this section we will quickly look at cost functions that can be
used when creating the neural network. Every cost function takes the
target vector as its parameter, and returns a function valued only at
X such that it may easily be differentiated.


!bc pycod
def CostOLS(target):
    """
    Return OLS function valued only at X, so
    that it may be easily differentiated
    """

    def func(X):
        return (1.0 / target.shape[0]) * np.sum((target - X) ** 2)

    return func


def CostLogReg(target):
    """
    Return Logistic Regression cost function
    valued only at X, so that it may be easily differentiated
    """

    def func(X):
        return -(1.0 / target.shape[0]) * np.sum(
            (target * np.log(X + 10e-10)) + ((1 - target) * np.log(1 - X + 10e-10))
        )

    return func


def CostCrossEntropy(target):
    """
    Return cross entropy cost function valued only at X, so
    that it may be easily differentiated
    """
    
    def func(X):
        return -(1.0 / target.size) * np.sum(target * np.log(X + 10e-10))

    return func

!ec

=== Usage of cost functions ===

Below we will provide a short example of how these cost function may
be used to obtain results if you wish to test them out on your own
using AutoGrad's automatic differentiation.

!bc pycod
from autograd import grad

target = np.array([[1, 2, 3]]).T
a = np.array([[4, 5, 6]]).T

cost_func = CostCrossEntropy
cost_func_derivative = grad(cost_func(target))

valued_at_a = cost_func_derivative(a)
print(f"Derivative of cost function {cost_func.__name__} valued at a:\n{valued_at_a}")
!ec

=== Activation functions ===

Finally, before we look at the layers that make up the neural network,
we will look at the activation functions which can be specified
between the hidden layers and as the output function. Each function
can be valued for any given vector or matrix X, and can be
differentiated via derivate().


!bc pycod

import autograd.numpy as np
from autograd import elementwise_grad

def identity(X):
    return X


def sigmoid(X):
    try:
        return 1.0 / (1 + np.exp(-X))
    except FloatingPointError:
        return np.where(X > np.zeros(X.shape), np.ones(X.shape), np.zeros(X.shape))


def softmax(X):
    X = X - np.max(X, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    delta = 10e-10
    return np.exp(X) / (np.sum(np.exp(X), axis=-1, keepdims=True) + delta)


def RELU(X):
    return np.where(X > np.zeros(X.shape), X, np.zeros(X.shape))


def LRELU(X):
    delta = 10e-4
    return np.where(X > np.zeros(X.shape), X, delta * X)


def derivate(func):
    if func.__name__ == "RELU":

        def func(X):
            return np.where(X > 0, 1, 0)

        return func

    elif func.__name__ == "LRELU":

        def func(X):
            delta = 10e-4
            return np.where(X > 0, 1, delta)

        return func

    else:
        return elementwise_grad(func)
!ec


=== Usage of activation functions ===

Below we present a short demonstration of how to use an activation
function. The derivative of the activation function will be important
when calculating the output delta term during backpropagation. Note
that derivate() can also be used for cost functions for a more
generalized approach.


!bc pycod
z = np.array([[4, 5, 6]]).T
print(f"Input to activation function:\n{z}")

act_func = sigmoid
a = act_func(z)
print(f"\nOutput from {act_func.__name__} activation function:\n{a}")

act_func_derivative = derivate(act_func)
valued_at_z = act_func_derivative(a)
print(f"\nDerivative of {act_func.__name__} activation function valued at z:\n{valued_at_z}")
!ec

=== Convolution ===

In order to construct a convolutional neural network (CNN), it is
crucial to comprehend the fundamental principles of convolution and
how it aids in extracting information from images. Convolution, at its
core, is merely a mathematical operation between two functions that
yields another function. It is represented by an integral between two
functions, which is typically expressed as:

!bt
\[
(f \ast g)(t):=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau) g(t-\tau) d \tau.
\]
!et

Here, $f$ and $g$ are the two functions on which we want to perform an
operation. The outcome of the convolution operation is represented by
$(f \ast g)$, and it is derived by sliding the function $g$ over $f$ and
computing the integral of their product at each position. If both
functions are continuous, convolution takes the form shown
above. However, if we discretize both $f$ and $g$, the convolution
operation will take the form of a sum between the elements of $f$ and $g$:
!bt
\[
(f \ast g)[n]=\sum_{m=0}^{n-1} f(m) g(n-m).
\]
!et

The key idea we utilize to extract the information contained in an
image is to slide an $m \times n$ matrix $g$ over an $m \times n$
matrix $f$. In our case, $f$ represents the image, while $g$
represents the kernel, oftentimes called a filter. However, since our
convolution will be a two-dimensional variant, we need to extend our
mathematical formula with an additional summation:

!bt
\[
(f \ast g)(i, j)\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(m,n) g(i-m, j-n).
\]
!et

It is imperative to note that the size of the kernel g is
significantly smaller than the size of the input image f, thereby
reducing the amount of computation necessary for feature
extraction. Furthermore, the kernel is usually a trainable parameter
in a convolutional neural network, allowing the network to learn
appropriate kernels for specific tasks.

To give you an example of how 2D convolution works in practice,
suppose we have an image $f$ of dimension $6 \times 6$

!bt
\[
f = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & 1 & 2 & 9 & 8 & 6 \\
9 & 5 & 9 & 5 & 8 & 5 \\
1 & 5 & 9 & 7 & 6 & 4 \\
2 & 9 & 8 & 3 & 7 & 1 \\
8 & 1 & 6 & 4 & 2 & 2 \\
1 & 0 & 5 & 7 & 8 & 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
!et

and a $3 \times 3$ kernel $g$ called a low-pass filter. Note that the
kernel is usually rotated by 180 degrees during convolution, however
this has no effect on this kernel.

!bt
\[
g = \frac{1}{9}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
!et

In order to filter the image, we have to extract a $3 \times 3$
element from the upper left corner of $f$, and perform element-wise
multiplication of the extracted image pixels with the elements of the
kernel $g$:

!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 1 & 2 \\
9 & 5 & 9 \\
1 & 5 & 9 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \\
\frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \\
\frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{4}{9} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{2}{9} \\
\frac{9}{9} & \frac{5}{9} & \frac{9}{9} \\
\frac{1}{9} & \frac{5}{9} & \frac{9}{9} \\
\end {bmatrix}
= \bm{A}
\]
!et

Then, following the multiplication, we summarize all the elements of the resulting matrix $\bm{A}$:

!bt
\[
(f \ast g)(0, 0)= \sum_{i=0}^{2} \sum_{j=0}^{2} a_{i,j} = 5,
\]
!et
which corresponds to the first element of the filtered image $(f \ast g)$.

Here we use a stride of $S=1$, a parameter denoted $S$ which describes how
many indexes we move the kernel $g$ to the right before repeating the
calculations above for the next $3 \times 3$ element of the image
$f$. It is usually presumed that $S=1$, however, larger values for $S$
can be used to reduce the dimentionality of the filtered image such
that the convolution operation is more computationally efficient. In
the context of a convolutional neural network, this will become very
useful.

The full result of the convolution is:

!bt
\[
(f \ast g) =
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 5.78 & 7 & 6.44 \\
6.33 & 6.67 & 6.89 & 5.11 \\
5.44 & 5.78 & 5.78 & 4 \\
4.44 & 4.78 & 5.56 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
!et

The result is markedly smaller in shape than the original image. This
occurs when using convolution without first padding the image with
additional columns and rows, allowing us to keep the original image
shape after sliding the kernel over the image.  How many rows and
columns we wish to pad the image with depends strictly on the shape of
the kernel, as we wish to pad the image with $r$ additional rows and
$c$ additional columns.

!bt
\[
r =\lfloor \frac{\mathrm{kernel height}}{2} \rfloor \cdot 2 \\
c =\lfloor \frac{\mathrm{kernel width}}{2} \rfloor \cdot 2
\]
!et

Note the notation $\lfloor \frac{\mathrm{kernel width}}{2} \rfloor$ means that
we floor the result of the division, meaning we round down to a whole
number in case $\frac{\mathrm{kernel width}}{2}$ results in a floating point
number.

Using those simple equations, we find out by how much we have to
extend the dimensions of the original image. Before proceeding,
however, we might ask what we shall fill the additional rows and
columns with? One of the most common approaches to padding is
zero-padding, which as the name suggest, involves filling the rows and
columns with zeros. This is the approach that we will be using for
this demonstration. If we apply this padding to out original $6 \times 6$
image, the result will be an $8 \times 8$ image as the kernel has a width and
height of 3. Note that the original image is encapsuled by the
zero-padded rows and columns:

!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 9 & 8 & 6 & 0 \\
0 & 9 & 5 & 9 & 5 & 8 & 5 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 5 & 9 & 7 & 6 & 4 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 9 & 8 & 3 & 7 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 8 & 1 & 6 & 4 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 5 & 7 & 8 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

Below we have provided code that demonstrates padding and
convolution. As you will see when we run the code, the size of the
image will remain unchanged when using padding.~

!bc pycod
import numpy as np

def padding(image, kernel):
    # calculate r and c
    r = (kernel.shape[0] // 2) * 2
    c = (kernel.shape[1] // 2) * 2
    
    # padded image dimensions
    padded_height = image.shape[0] + r
    padded_width = image.shape[1] + c
    
    # for more readable code
    k_half_height = kernel.shape[0] // 2
    k_half_width = kernel.shape[1] // 2

    # zero matrix with padded dimensions
    padded_img = np.zeros((padded_height, padded_width))

    # place image into zero matrix
    padded_img[k_half_height : padded_height - k_half_height,
               k_half_width : padded_width - k_half_width] = image[:, :]

    return padded_img

def convolve(original_image, padded_image, kernel, stride=1):
    # rotate kernel by 180 degrees
    kernel = np.rot90(np.rot90(kernel))

    # note that kernel height // 2 is written as 'm'
    # and kernel width // 2 as 'n' in the mathematical notation
    m = kernel.shape[0] // 2
    n = kernel.shape[1] // 2
    
    r = (kernel.shape[0] // 2) * 2
    c = (kernel.shape[1] // 2) * 2
    
    # initialize output array
    convolved_image = np.zeros(original_image.shape)
    image_height = original_image.shape[0]
    image_width = original_image.shape[1]

    # the convolution
    for i in range(m, image_height + m, stride):
        for j in range(n, image_width + n, stride):
            convolved_image[i-m, j-n] = np.sum(
                padded_image[i : i + m, j : j + n]
                * kernel
            )
            
    return convolved_image

def convolve(image, kernel, stride=1):
    for i in range(2):
        kernel = np.rot90(kernel)

    k_half_height = kernel.shape[0] // 2
    k_half_width = kernel.shape[0] // 2

    conv_image = np.zeros(image.shape)
    pad_image = padding(image, kernel)

    for i in range(k_half_height, conv_image.shape[0] + k_half_height, stride):
        for j in range(k_half_width, conv_image.shape[1] + k_half_width, stride):
            conv_image[i - k_half_height, j - k_half_width] = np.sum(
                pad_image[
                    i - k_half_height : i + k_half_height + 1, j - k_half_width : j + k_half_width + 1
                ]
                * kernel
            )

    return conv_image
!ec

Fun fact: When filtering images, you will see that convolution
involves rotating the kernel by 180 degrees.  However, this is not the
case when applying convolution in a CNN, where the same operation that is not
rotated by 180 degrees is called cross-correlation, which is normally implemented in most libraries.

!bc pycod

original_image = np.array([[4, 1, 2, 9, 8, 6],
                 [9, 5, 9, 5, 8, 5],
                 [1, 5, 9, 7, 6, 4],
                 [2, 9, 8, 3, 7, 1],
                 [8, 1, 6, 4, 2, 2],
                 [1, 0, 5, 7, 8, 2]])

kernel = (1/9)*np.ones((3,3))

print(f"{original_image.shape=}")

# note that convolve() performs padding
convolved_image = convolve(original_image, kernel, stride=1)

print(f"{convolved_image.shape=}")
!ec

As you can see, the resulting image is of the same size as the
original image. To round of our demonstration of convolution, we will
present the results of convolution using commonly used kernels. In a
CNN, the values of the kernels are randomly initialized, and then
learned during training. These kernels will extract information
regarding the picture, such as for example the edge detection filter
demonstrated below extracts the edges present in the picture. Of
course, there is no guarantee that the CNN will learn an edge
detection filter, but this should provide some intuiton as to how the
CNN is able to use kernels to make better predictions than a regular
feed forward neural network.

=== Convolution2DLayer: convolution in a hidden layer ===

After establishing the foundational understanding of applying
convolution to spatial data, let us delve into the intricate workings
of a convolutional layer in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The
primary function of convolution, as previously discussed, is to
extract pertinent information from images while simultaneously
decreasing the scale of our data. To initiate the image processing, we
shall begin by partitioning the images into color channels (unless the
image is grayscale), comprising three primary colors: red, green, and
blue. We will subsequently utilize trainable kernels to construct a
higher-dimensional encoding of each channel called feature
maps. Successive layers will receive these feature maps as inputs,
generating further encodings, albeit with reduced dimensions. The term
trainable kernels denotes the initialization of pre-defined
kernel-shaped weights, which we will then train via backpropagation,
similar to how weights are trained in a Feedforward Neural Network.

 
To ensure seamless integration between our implementation of the
convolutional layer and popular machine learning frameworks like
Tensorflow (Keras) and PyTorch, we have adopted a design pattern that
mirrors the construction of models using these APIs. This involves
implementing our convolutional layer as a Python class or object,
which allows for a more modular and flexible approach to building
neural networks. By structuring our code in this way, users can easily
incorporate our implementation into their existing machine learning
pipelines without having to make significant changes to their
codebase. Additionally, this design pattern promotes code reusability
and makes it easier to maintain and update our convolutional layer
implementation over time.

 
Note that the Convolution2DLayer takes in an activation function as a parameter, as it also performs non-linearity.

=== Backpropagation in the convolutional layer ===

As you may have noticed, we have not yet explained how the
backpropagation algorithm works in a convolutional layer. However,
having covered all other major details about convolutional layers, we
are now prepared to do so. It should come as no surprise that the
calculation of delta terms at each convolutional layer takes the form
of convolution. After the gradient has been propagated backwards
through the flattening layer, where it was reshaped into an
appropriate form, calculating the update value for the kernel is
simply a matter of convolving the output gradient with the input of
the layer for which we are updating the weights. For more detail, this
article serves as an excellent resource, see
URL:"https://pavisj.medium.com/convolutions-and-backpropagations-46026a8f5d2c"

=== Demonstration ===

We can use the convolutional layer above to perform a simple convolution on an image of the now familiar cute dog.

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
import imageio.v3 as imageio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_convolution_result(X, layer):
    plt.imshow(X[0, 0, :, :], vmin=0, vmax=255, cmap="gray")
    plt.title("Original image")
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()
    conv_result = layer._feedforward(X)
    plt.title("Result of convolutional layer")
    plt.imshow(conv_result[0, 0, :, :], vmin=0, vmax=255, cmap="gray")
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()

# create layer
layer = Convolution2DLayer(
    input_channels=3,
    feature_maps=1,
    kernel_height=4,
    kernel_width=4,
    v_stride=2,
    h_stride=2,
    pad="same",
    act_func=identity,
    seed=2023,
    )

# read in image path, make data correct format
img_path = img_path = "data/IMG-2167.JPG"
image_of_cute_dog = imageio.imread(img_path)
image_shape = image_of_cute_dog.shape
image_of_cute_dog = image_of_cute_dog.reshape(1, image_shape[0], image_shape[1], image_shape[2])
image_of_cute_dog = image_of_cute_dog.transpose(0, 3, 1, 2)

# plot the result of the convolution
plot_convolution_result(image_of_cute_dog, layer)
!ec

We cobserve that the result has half the pixels on each axis due to
the fact that we've used a horizontal and vertical stride of 2. The
result of this convolution is not very insightfull, as the kernel has
completely random values for the first feedforward pass. However, as
we perform multiple forward and backward passes, the results of the
convolution should provide identifying features of the image it uses
for classification.


Note that image data usually comes in many different shapes and sizes,
but for our CNN we require the input data be formatted as \[Number of
inputs, input channels, input height, input width\]. Occasionally, the
data you come accross use will be formatted like this, but on many
occasions reshaping and transposing the dimensions is sadly necessary.

=== Pooling Layer ===

The pooling layer is another widely used type of layer in
convolutional neural networks that enables data downsampling to a more
manageable size. Despite recent technological advancements that allow
for convolution without excessive size reduction of the data, the
pooling layer still remains a fundamental component of convolutional
neural networks. It can be used before, after, or in between
convolutional layers, although finding the optimal placement of layers
and network depth requires experimentation to achieve the best
performance for a given problem. The code we provide allows you to
perform two types of pooling known as max pooling and average pooling.

=== Flattening Layer ===

Before we can begin building our first CNN model, we need to introduce
the flattening layer. As its name suggests, the flattening layer
transforms the data into a one-dimensional vector that can be fed into
the feedforward layers of our network. This layer plays a crucial role
in preparing the data for further processing in the
network. Additionally, the flattening layer is responsible for
reshaping the gradient to the proper shape during
backpropagation. This ensures that the kernels are correctly updated,
allowing for effective learning in the network.

class FlattenLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, act_func=LRELU, seed=None):
        super().__init__(seed)
        self.act_func = act_func

    def _feedforward(self, X_batch):
        # save input for backpropagation
        self.X_batch_feedforward_shape = X_batch.shape
        # Remember, the data has the following shape: (I, FM, H, W, ) in the convolutional layers
        # whilst the data has the shape (I, FM * H * W) in the fully connected layers
        # I = Inputs, FM = Feature Maps, H = Height and W = Width.
        X_batch = X_batch.reshape(
            X_batch.shape[input_index],
            X_batch.shape[feature_maps_index]

            * X_batch.shape[width_index],
        )

=== Fully Connected Layers ===

Finally, the result from the flatten layer will pass to a series of
fully connected layers, which function as a normal feed forward neural
network. The fully connected layers are split into two classes;
FullyConnectedLayer which acts as a hidden layer, and OutputLayer,
which acts as the single output layer at the end of the CNN. If one
wishes to use this codebase to construct a normal feed forward neural
network, it must start with a FlattenLayer due to techincal details
regarding weight intitialization. However many FullyConnectedLayers
can be added to the CNN, and in each layer the amount of nodes, which
activation function and scheduler to use can be specified. In
practice, the scheduler will be specified in the CNN object
initialization, and inherited if no other scheduler is specified.

=== Optimized Convolution2DLayer ===

For our CNN, we have also implemented an optimized version of the
Convolution2DLayer, Convolution2DLayerOPT, which runs much faster. See
VII. Remarks for discussion. This layer will per default be used by
the CNN due to its computational advantages, but is much less
readable. We've documented it such that specially interested students
can understand the principles behind it, but it is not recommended to
read. In short, we reshape and transpose parts of the image such that
the convolutional operation can be swapped out for a simple matrix
multiplication.

=== Usage of CNN code ===

Using the CNN codebase is very simple. We begin by initiating a CNN
object, which takes a cost function, a scheduler and a seed as its
arguments. If a scheduler is not provided, it will per default
initiate an Adam scheduler with eta=1e-4, and if a seed is not
provided, the CNN will not be seeded, meaning it will run with a
different random seed every run. Below we demonstrate an initiation of
our CNN.

!bc pycod
adam_scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-3, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
cnn = CNN(cost_func=CostCrossEntropy, scheduler=adam_scheduler, seed=2023)
!ec

Now that we have our CNN object, we can begin to add layers to it!
Many of the add_layer functions have default values, for example
add_Convolution2DLayer() has a default v_stride and h_stride of
1. However, these can of course be set to any value you please. Note
that the input channels of a subsequent convolutional layer must equal
the previous convolutional layer's feature maps.

!bc pycod
cnn.add_Convolution2DLayer(
    input_channels=1,
    feature_maps=1,
    kernel_height=3,
    kernel_width=3,
    act_func=LRELU,
)

cnn.add_FlattenLayer()

cnn.add_FullyConnectedLayer(30, LRELU)

cnn.add_FullyConnectedLayer(20, LRELU)

cnn.add_OutputLayer(10, softmax)
!ec

Here we have created a CNN with the following architecture:
 
o A convolutional layer with 1 input channel, with a kernel height of 2 and a width of 2, which uses LRELU as its non-linearity function. This layer outputs 1 feature map, which feed into the subsequent layer.

o A flatten layer

o A hidden layer with 30 nodes, with LRELU as its activation function

o Another hidden layer but with 20 nodes

o The output layer, with softmax as its activation function and 10 nodes. We use 10 nodes because we will be using a dataset with 10 classes.

Now, before we can train the model, we need to load in our data. We
will use the MNIST dataset and use 10000 $28 \times  28$ images.

!bc pycod
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def onehot(target: np.ndarray):
    onehot = np.zeros((target.size, target.max() + 1))
    onehot[np.arange(target.size), target] = 1
    return onehot

# get dataset
dataset = fetch_openml("mnist_784", parser="auto")
mnist = dataset.data.to_numpy(dtype="float")[:10000, :]

# scale data
for i in range(mnist.shape[1]):
    mnist[:, i] /= 255
    
# reshape to add single input channel to data shape [inputs, input_channels, height, width]
mnist = mnist.reshape(mnist.shape[0], 1, 28, 28)

# one hot encode target as we are doing multi-class classification
target = onehot(np.array([int(i) for i in dataset.target.to_numpy()[:10000]]))

# split into training and validation data
x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(mnist, target)
!ec

Now we may train our model. Note that we can utilize regularization in
the CNN by using the lam (lambda) parameter in fit(), and utilize
different types of gradient descent by specifying the amount of
batches via the batches parameter as shown below.
 
The functionfit() returns a score dictionary of the training error and
accuracy (and validation error and accuracy if a validation set is
provided) which can be used to plot the error and accuracy of the
model over epochs.

!bc pycod
scores = cnn.fit(
    x_train,
    y_train,
    lam=1e-5,
    batches=10,
    epochs=100,
    X_val=x_val,
    t_val=y_val,
)

plt.plot(scores["train_acc"], label="Training")
plt.plot(scores["val_acc"], label="Validation")
plt.ylim([0.8,1])
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.ylabel("Accuracy")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
!ec

Considering we only trained the model for 100 epochs without any tuning of the hyperparameters, this result is pretty good.
 
The codebase allows for great flexibility in CNN
architectures. Pooling layers can be added before, inbetween or after
convolutional layers, but due to the great optimizations made within
Convolution2DLayerOPT, we recommend using the v_stride and h_stride
parameters in add_Convolution2DLayer() to reduce the dimentionality of
the problem as the pooling layer is slow in comparison. To use the
unoptimized version of Convolution2DLayer, simply pass optimized=False
as an argument in add_Convolution2DLayer().

If one wishes to perform binary classification using the CNN, simply
use the cost function 'CostLogReg' when initializing the CNN and use 1
node at the OutputLayer.
 
Below we have created another, more untraditional architecture using
our code to demonstrate its flexibility and different attributes such
as asymmetric stride that might become useful when constructing your
own CNN.

!bc pycod
adam_scheduler = Adam(eta=1e-3, rho=0.9, rho2=0.999)
cnn = CNN(cost_func=CostCrossEntropy, scheduler=adam_scheduler, seed=2023)

cnn.add_Convolution2DLayer(
    input_channels=1,
    feature_maps=7,
    kernel_height=7,
    kernel_width=1,
    act_func=LRELU,
)

cnn.add_PoolingLayer(
    kernel_height=2,
    kernel_width=2,
    pooling="average",
)

cnn.add_PoolingLayer(
    kernel_height=2,
    kernel_width=2,
    pooling="max",
)

cnn.add_Convolution2DLayer(
    input_channels=7,
    feature_maps=1,
    kernel_height=4,
    kernel_width=4,
    v_stride=2,
    h_stride=3,
    act_func=LRELU,
    optimized=False,
)

cnn.add_Convolution2DLayer(
    input_channels=1,
    feature_maps=1,
    kernel_height=2,
    kernel_width=2,
    act_func=sigmoid,
    optimized=True,
)

cnn.add_PoolingLayer(
    kernel_height=2,
    kernel_width=2,
    pooling="max"
)

cnn.add_FlattenLayer()

cnn.add_FullyConnectedLayer(100, LRELU)

cnn.add_FullyConnectedLayer(10, sigmoid)

cnn.add_FullyConnectedLayer(101, identity)

cnn.add_OutputLayer(10, softmax)
!ec

Here we see the use of asymmetrical 1D kernels such as the $7 \times
1$ kernel in the first convolutional layer, both max and average
pooling, asymmetric stride in the unoptimized convolutional layer,
more pooling, a flatten layer, a hidden layer with 100 nodes using
LRELU, another hidden layer with 10 hidden nodes that uses the sigmoid
activation function, and another hidden layer with 101 nodes which
utilizes no activation function (identity). Finally, we arrive at the
output layer with 10 nodes, which uses softmax as its activation
function.

=== Additional Remarks ===


The stride parameter controls the distance between each convolution
and the kernel/filter. If our image is padded, stride is the only
parameter that determines the size of the output from a convolutional
layer. However, if we decide not to perform any padding, the size of
the output feature map depends on both the stride and kernel size. It
is important to note that neither the stride nor the kernel has to be
symmetrical. This means that we can use a rectangular filter if we
choose, and the stride in the vertical direction (axis=0 in Python)
does not need to be the same as the stride in the horizontal direction
(axis=1 in Python). It may even be the case that asymmetric
combinations of stride or kernel dimensions, or both, yield better
results than symmetric values for these parameters.

!bc pycod
def convolve(image, kernel, stride=1):
    for i in range(2):
        kernel = np.rot90(kernel)

    k_half_height = kernel.shape[0] // 2
    k_half_width = kernel.shape[0] // 2

    conv_image = np.zeros(image.shape)
    pad_image = padding(image, kernel)

    for i in range(k_half_height, conv_image.shape[0] + k_half_height, stride):
        for j in range(k_half_width, conv_image.shape[1] + k_half_width, stride):
            conv_image[i - k_half_height, j - k_half_width] = np.sum(
                pad_image[
                    i - k_half_height : i + k_half_height + 1, j - k_half_width : j + k_half_width + 1
                ]
                * kernel
            )

    return conv_image
!ec

=== Remarks on the speed  ===

Despite the naive convolution algorithm shown above working finely, it
is extremely slow, requiring approximately 20-30 seconds to process a
single image. The time complexity of 2D convolution, which is O(NMnm),
rapidly becomes a constraint and may, at worst, make computations
infeasible. Consequently, optimizing the naive 2D convolution
algorithm is a necessity, as the execution time of the algorithm
significantly increases as the input data size expands. This can pose
a bottleneck in applications that necessitate real-time processing of
large data volumes, such as image and video processing, deep learning,
and scientific simulations.

To address this issue, we shall present two widely used optimization
techniques: the separable kernel approach and Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). Both of these methods can drastically reduce the computational
complexity of convolution and enhance the overall efficiency of
processing substantial data quantities. While we shall refrain from
delving into the intricacies of these algorithms, we strongly
encourage you to examine at least the application of FFT to optimize
computations.

By taking advantage of the capabilities of separable kernels, we can
effectively cut the computational expense of filtering an image in
half. Yet, if we seek even more rapid processing, we can turn to the
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm provided by the numpy
library. By utilizing FFT to transform the input image and filter into
the frequency domain, we can perform convolution in this domain. This
approach significantly reduces the number of operations needed and
results in a marked speedup relative to other convolution
techniques. In addition, it is worth noting that the FFT is widely
regarded as one of the most critical algorithms developed to date,
with applications ranging from digital signal processing to scientific
computing.

=== Convolution in the Fourier domain ===
!bc pycod
start_time = time.time()
img_fft = np.fft.fft2(image_of_cute_dog)
kernel_fft = np.fft.fft2(sobel_kernel, s=image_of_cute_dog.shape)

conv_image = img_fft * kernel_fft

filtered_image = np.fft.ifft2(conv_image)
print(f'Time take for convolution in the fourier domain: {time.time() - start_time}')
plt.imshow(filtered_image.real, cmap="gray", vmin=0, vmax=255, aspect="auto")
plt.show()
!ec

It is evident that executing convolution in the Fourier domain yields
the quickest computation time. Nonetheless, one should exercise
caution, particularly when dealing with images of relatively small
dimensions, as one of the other methods may prove to be more
expeditious than FFT-enhanced convolution. The overhead involved in
transferring both the image and filter into the Fourier domain,
followed by their subsequent transformation back into the spatial
domain, results in a minor inconvenience. Therefore, it is imperative
to remain cognizant of this fact when utilizing FFT as the primary
optimization technique.










!split
===== From FFNNs and CNNs to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) =====

There are limitation of FFNNs, one of which being that FFNNs are not
designed to handle sequential data (data for which the order matters)
effectively because they lack the capabilities of storing information
about previous inputs; each input is being treated indepen-
dently. This is a limitation when dealing with sequential data where
past information can be vital to correctly process current and future
inputs. 


!split
===== Feedback connections =====


In contrast to FFNNs, recurrent networks introduce feedback
connections, meaning the information is allowed to be carried to
subsequent nodes across different time steps. These cyclic or feedback
connections have the objective of providing the network with some kind
of memory, making RNNs particularly suited for time- series data,
natural language processing, speech recognition, and several other
problems for which the order of the data is crucial.  The RNN
architectures vary greatly in how they manage information flow and
memory in the network.


!split
===== Vanishing gradients =====

Different architectures often aim at improving
some sub-optimal characteristics of the network. The simplest form of
recurrent network, commonly called simple or vanilla RNN, for example,
is known to suffer from the problem of vanishing gradients. This
problem arises due to the nature of backpropagation in time. Gradients
of the cost/loss function may get exponentially small (or large) if
there are many layers in the network, which is the case of RNN when
the sequence gets long.




!split
===== Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): Overarching view =====

Till now our focus has been, including convolutional neural networks
as well, on feedforward neural networks. The output or the activations
flow only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) looks very much like a feedforward
neural network, except that it also has connections pointing
backward. 

RNNs are used to analyze time series data such as stock prices, and
tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems, they can
anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally,
they can work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on
fixed-sized inputs like all the nets we have discussed so far. For
example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio samples as
input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing
systems such as automatic translation and speech-to-text.

!split
===== Sequential data only? =====

An important issue is that in many deep learning methods we assume
that the input and output data can be treated as independent and
identically distributed, normally abbreviated to _iid_.
This means that the data we use can be seen as mutually independent.

This is however not the case for most data sets used in RNNs since we
are dealing with sequences of data with strong inter-dependencies.
This applies in particular to time series, which are sequential by
contruction.

!split
===== Differential equations =====

As an example, the solutions of ordinary differential equations can be
represented as a time series, similarly, how stock prices evolve as
function of time is another example of a typical time series, or voice
records and many other examples.


Not all sequential data may however have a time stamp, texts being a
typical example thereof, or DNA sequences.

The main focus here is on data that can be structured either as time
series or as ordered series of data.  We will not focus on for example
natural language processing or similar data sets.

===== RNNs =====

RNNs are very powerful, because they
combine two properties:
o Distributed hidden state that allows them to store a lot of information about the past efficiently.
o Non-linear dynamics that allows them to update their hidden state in complicated ways.

With enough neurons and time, RNNs
can compute anything that can be
computed by your computer.



!split
===== What kinds of behaviour can RNNs exhibit? =====

o They can oscillate. 
o They can settle to point attractors.
o They can behave chaotically.
o RNNs could potentially learn to implement lots of small programs that each capture a nugget of knowledge and run in parallel, interacting to produce very complicated effects.

But the extensive computational needs  of RNNs makes them very hard to train.

!split
===== Solving differential equations with RNNs =====

To gain some intuition on how we can use RNNs for time series, let us
tailor the representation of the solution of a differential equation
as a time series.

Consider the famous differential equation (Newton's equation of motion for damped harmonic oscillations, scaled in terms of dimensionless time)

!bt
\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\eta\frac{dx}{dt}+x(t)=F(t),
\]
!et
where $\eta$ is a constant used in scaling time into a dimensionless variable and $F(t)$ is an external force acting on the system.
The constant $\eta$ is a so-called damping.

!split
===== Two first-order differential equations =====

In solving the above second-order equation, it is common to rewrite it in terms of two coupled first-order equations
with the velocity
!bt
\[
v(t)=\frac{dx}{dt},
\]
!et
and the acceleration
!bt
\[
\frac{dv}{dt}=F(t)-\eta v(t)-x(t).
\]
!et

With the initial conditions $v_0=v(t_0)$ and $x_0=x(t_0)$ defined, we can integrate these equations and find their respective solutions.

!split
===== Velocity only =====

Let us focus on the velocity only. Discretizing and using the simplest
possible approximation for the derivative, we have Euler's forward
method for the updated velocity at a time step $i+1$ given by
!bt
\[
v_{i+1}=v_i+\Delta t \frac{dv}{dt}_{\vert_{v=v_i}}=v_i+\Delta t\left(F_i-\eta v_i-x_i\right).
\]
!et
Defining a function
!bt
\[
h_i(x_i,v_i,F_i)=v_i+\Delta t\left(F_i-\eta v_i-x_i\right),
\]
!et
we have
!bt
\[
v_{i+1}=h_i(x_i,v_i,F_i).
\]
!et

!split
===== Linking with RNNs =====

The equation
!bt
\[
v_{i+1}=h_i(x_i,v_i,F_i).
\]
!et
can be used to train a feed-forward neural network with inputs $v_i$ and outputs $v_{i+1}$ at a time $t_i$. But we can think of this also as a recurrent neural network
with inputs $v_i$, $x_i$ and $F_i$ at each time step $t_i$, and producing an output $v_{i+1}$.

Noting that 
!bt
\[
v_{i}=v_{i-1}+\Delta t\left(F_{i-1}-\eta v_{i-1}-x_{i-1}\right)=h_{i-1}.
\]
!et
we have
!bt
\[
v_{i}=h_{i-1}(x_{i-1},v_{i-1},F_{i-1}),
\]
!et
and we can rewrite
!bt
\[
v_{i+1}=h_i(x_i,h_{i-1},F_i).
\]
!et

!split
===== Minor rewrite =====

We can thus set up a recurring series which depends on the inputs $x_i$ and $F_i$ and the previous values $h_{i-1}$.
We assume now that the inputs at each step (or time $t_i$) is given by $x_i$ only and we denote the outputs for $\tilde{y}_i$ instead of $v_{i_1}$, we have then the compact equation for our outputs at each step $t_i$
!bt
\[
y_{i}=h_i(x_i,h_{i-1}).
\]
!et

We can think of this as an element in a recurrent network where our
network (our model) produces an output $y_i$ which is then compared
with a target value through a given cost/loss function that we
optimize. The target values at a given step $t_i$ could be the results
of a measurement or simply the analytical results of a differential
equation.

!split
===== Backpropagation through time =====

!bblock
We can think of the recurrent net as a layered, feed-forward
net with shared weights and then train the feed-forward net
with weight constraints.
!eblock

We can also think of this training algorithm in the time domain:
o The forward pass builds up a stack of the activities of all the units at each time step.
o The backward pass peels activities off the stack to compute the error derivatives at each time step.
o After the backward pass we add together the derivatives at all the different times for each weight. 

!split
===== The backward pass is linear =====

o There is a big difference between the forward and backward passes.
o In the forward pass we use squashing functions (like the logistic) to prevent the activity vectors from exploding.
o The backward pass, is completely linear. If you double the error derivatives at the final layer, all the error derivatives will double.

The forward pass determines the slope of the linear function used for
backpropagating through each neuron


!split 
===== The problem of exploding or vanishing gradients =====
* What happens to the magnitude of the gradients as we backpropagate through many layers?
  o If the weights are small, the gradients shrink exponentially.
  o If the weights are big the gradients grow exponentially.
* Typical feed-forward neural nets can cope with these exponential effects because they only have a few hidden layers.
* In an RNN trained on long sequences (e.g. 100 time steps) the gradients can easily explode or vanish.
  o We can avoid this by initializing the weights very carefully.
* Even with good initial weights, its very hard to detect that the current target output depends on an input from many time-steps ago.


RNNs have difficulty dealing with long-range dependencies. 

!split
===== Mathematical setup =====

    \mathbf{h}^{(t)} &= \sigma_h(\mathbf{a}^{(t)}), \notag\\
    \mathbf{y}^{(t)} &= V * \mathbf{h}^{(t)} + \mathbf{c}, \notag\\
    \mathbf{\hat{y}}^{(t)} &= \sigma_y(\mathbf{y}^{(t)}).

===== Back propagation in time in equations =====

To derive the expression of the gradients of $\mathcal{L}$ for
the RNN, we need to start recursively from the nodes closer to the
output layer in the temporal unrolling scheme - such as $\mathbf{y}$
and $\mathbf{h}$ at final time $t = \tau$,

!bt
\begin{align*}
    (\nabla_{ \mathbf{y}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L})_{i} &= \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial L^{(t)}}\frac{\partial L^{(t)}}{\partial y_{i}^{(t)}}, \notag\\
    \nabla_{\mathbf{h}^{(\tau)}} \mathcal{L} &= \mathbf{V}^\mathsf{T}\nabla_{ \mathbf{y}^{(\tau)}} \mathcal{L}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Chain rule again =====
For the following hidden nodes, we have to iterate through time, so by the chain rule, 

!bt
\begin{align*}
    \nabla_{\mathbf{h}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L} &= \left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{h}^{(t+1)}}{\partial\mathbf{h}^{(t)}}\right)^\mathsf{T}\nabla_{\mathbf{h}^{(t+1)}}\mathcal{L} + \left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{y}^{(t)}}{\partial\mathbf{h}^{(t)}}\right)^\mathsf{T}\nabla_{ \mathbf{y}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Gradients of loss functions =====
Similarly, the gradients of $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the weights and biases follow,

!bt
\begin{align*}
    \nabla_{\mathbf{c}} \mathcal{L} &=\sum_{t}\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{y}^{(t)}}{\partial \mathbf{c}}\right)^\mathsf{T} \nabla_{\mathbf{y}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L} \notag\\
    \nabla_{\mathbf{b}} \mathcal{L} &=\sum_{t}\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{h}^{(t)}}{\partial \mathbf{b}}\right)^\mathsf{T}        \nabla_{\mathbf{h}^{(t)}} \mathcal{L} \notag\\
    \nabla_{\mathbf{V}} \mathcal{L} &=\sum_{t}\sum_{i}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y_i^{(t)} }\right)\nabla_{\mathbf{V}^{(t)}}y_i^{(t)} \notag\\
    \nabla_{\mathbf{W}} \mathcal{L} &=\sum_{t}\sum_{i}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial h_i^{(t)}}\right)\nabla_{\mathbf{w}^{(t)}} h_i^{(t)} \notag\\
    \nabla_{\mathbf{U}} \mathcal{L} &=\sum_{t}\sum_{i}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial h_i^{(t)}}\right)\nabla_{\mathbf{U}^{(t)}}h_i^{(t)}.
    \label{eq:rnn_gradients3}

!split
===== Summary of RNNs =====

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have in general no probabilistic component
in a model. With a given fixed input and target from data, the RNNs learn the intermediate
association between various layers.
The inputs, outputs, and internal representation (hidden states) are all
real-valued vectors.

In a  traditional NN, it is assumed that every input is
independent of each other.  But with sequential data, the input at a given stage $t$ depends on the input from the previous stage $t-1$

!split
===== Summary of a  typical RNN =====

o Weight matrices $U$, $W$ and $V$ that connect the input layer at a stage $t$ with the hidden layer $h_t$, the previous hidden layer $h_{t-1}$ with $h_t$ and the hidden layer $h_t$ connecting with the output layer at the same stage and producing an output $\tilde{y}_t$, respectively.
o The output from the hidden layer $h_t$ is oftem modulated by a $\tanh{}$ function $h_t=\sigma_h(x_t,h_{t-1})=\tanh{(Ux_t+Wh_{t-1}+b)}$ with $b$ a bias value
o The output from the hidden layer produces $\tilde{y}_t=\sigma_y(Vh_t+c)$ where $c$ is a new bias parameter.
o The output from the training at a given stage is in turn compared with the observation $y_t$ thorugh a chosen cost function.

The function $g$ can any of the standard activation functions, that is a Sigmoid, a Softmax, a ReLU and other.
The parameters are trained through the so-called back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm.




!split
===== Four effective ways to learn an RNN and preparing for next week =====
o Long Short Term Memory Make the RNN out of little modules that are designed to remember values for a long time.
o Hessian Free Optimization: Deal with the vanishing gradients problem by using a fancy optimizer that can detect directions with a tiny gradient but even smaller curvature.
o Echo State Networks: Initialize the input a hidden and hidden-hidden and output-hidden connections very carefully so that the hidden state has a huge reservoir of weakly coupled oscillators which can be selectively driven by the input.
  * ESNs only need to learn the hidden-output connections.
o Good initialization with momentum Initialize like in Echo State Networks, but then learn all of the connections using momentum


!split
===== Gating mechanism: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) =====

Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, as discussed above, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b"
and URL:"https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b".


LSTM uses a memory cell for  modeling long-range dependencies and avoid vanishing gradient  problems.
Capable of modeling longer term dependencies by having
memory cells and gates that controls the information flow along
with the memory cells.

o Introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) who solved the problem of getting an RNN to remember things for a long time (like hundreds of time steps).
o They designed a memory cell using logistic and linear units with multiplicative interactions.
o Information gets into the cell whenever its “write” gate is on.
o The information stays in the cell so long as its _keep_ gate is on.
o Information can be read from the cell by turning on its _read_ gate. 


!split
===== Implementing a memory cell in a neural network =====

To preserve information for a long time in
the activities of an RNN, we use a circuit
that implements an analog memory cell.

o A linear unit that has a self-link with a weight of 1 will maintain its state.
o Information is stored in the cell by activating its write gate.
o Information is retrieved by activating the read gate.
o We can backpropagate through this circuit because logistics are have nice derivatives. 


!split
===== LSTM details =====

The LSTM is a unit cell that is made of three gates:
o the input gate,
o the forget gate,
o and the output gate.

It also introduces a cell state $c$, which can be thought of as the
long-term memory, and a hidden state $h$ which can be thought of as
the short-term memory.

!split
===== Basic layout =====

FIGURE: [figslides/lstm.pdf, width=700 frac=1.0]

!split
===== More LSTM details =====

The first stage is called the forget gate, where we combine the input
at (say, time $t$), and the hidden cell state input at $t-1$, passing
it through the Sigmoid activation function and then performing an
element-wise multiplication, denoted by $\otimes$.

It follows 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{f}^{(t)} = \sigma(W_f\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_f\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_f)
\]
!et
where $W$ and $U$ are the weights respectively.

!split
===== The forget gate =====

This is called the forget gate since the Sigmoid activation function's
outputs are very close to $0$ if the argument for the function is very
negative, and $1$ if the argument is very positive. Hence we can
control the amount of information we want to take from the long-term
memory.

!split
===== Input gate =====

The next stage is the input gate, which consists of both a Sigmoid
function ($\sigma_i$), which decide what percentage of the input will
be stored in the long-term memory, and the $\tanh_i$ function, which
decide what is the full memory that can be stored in the long term
memory. When these results are calculated and multiplied together, it
is added to the cell state or stored in the long-term memory, denoted
as $\oplus$. 

We have
!bt
\[
\mathbf{i}^{(t)} = \sigma_g(W_i\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_i\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_i),
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\mathbf{\tilde{c}}^{(t)} = \tanh(W_c\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_c\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_c),
\]
!et
again the $W$ and $U$ are the weights.

!split
===== Forget and input =====

The forget gate and the input gate together also update the cell state with the following equation, 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{c}^{(t)} = \mathbf{f}^{(t)} \otimes \mathbf{c}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{i}^{(t)} \otimes \mathbf{\tilde{c}}^{(t)},
\]
!et
where $f^{(t)}$ and $i^{(t)}$ are the outputs of the forget gate and the input gate, respectively.

!split
===== Output gate =====

The final stage of the LSTM is the output gate, and its purpose is to
update the short-term memory.  To achieve this, we take the newly
generated long-term memory and process it through a hyperbolic tangent
($\tanh$) function creating a potential new short-term memory. We then
multiply this potential memory by the output of the Sigmoid function
($\sigma_o$). This multiplication generates the final output as well
as the input for the next hidden cell ($h^{\langle t \rangle}$) within
the LSTM cell.

We have 
!bt
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{o}^{(t)} &= \sigma_g(W_o\mathbf{x}^{(t)} + U_o\mathbf{h}^{(t-1)} + \mathbf{b}_o), \\
\mathbf{h}^{(t)} &= \mathbf{o}^{(t)} \otimes \sigma_h(\mathbf{c}^{(t)}). \\
\end{aligned}
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{W_o,U_o}$ are the weights of the output gate and $\mathbf{b_o}$ is the bias of the output gate.

    "## Using gradient descent methods, limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gradient descent (GD) finds local minima of our function**. Since the GD algorithm is deterministic, if it converges, it will converge to a local minimum of our cost/loss/risk function. Because in ML we are often dealing with extremely rugged landscapes with many local minima, this can lead to poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GD is sensitive to initial conditions**. One consequence of the local nature of GD is that initial conditions matter. Depending on where one starts, one will end up at a different local minima. Therefore, it is very important to think about how one initializes the training process. This is true for GD as well as more complicated variants of GD.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gradients are computationally expensive to calculate for large datasets**. In many cases in statistics and ML, the cost/loss/risk function is a sum of terms, with one term for each data point. For example, in linear regression, $E \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{w}^T\\cdot\\mathbf{x}_i)^2$; for logistic regression, the square error is replaced by the cross entropy. To calculate the gradient we have to sum over *all* $n$ data points. Doing this at every GD step becomes extremely computationally expensive. An ingenious solution to this, is to calculate the gradients using small subsets of the data called \"mini batches\". This has the added benefit of introducing stochasticity into our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GD is very sensitive to choices of learning rates**. GD is extremely sensitive to the choice of learning rates. If the learning rate is very small, the training process take an extremely long time. For larger learning rates, GD can diverge and give poor results. Furthermore, depending on what the local landscape looks like, we have to modify the learning rates to ensure convergence. Ideally, we would *adaptively* choose the learning rates to match the landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GD treats all directions in parameter space uniformly.** Another major drawback of GD is that unlike Newton's method, the learning rate for GD is the same in all directions in parameter space. For this reason, the maximum learning rate is set by the behavior of the steepest direction and this can significantly slow down training. Ideally, we would like to take large steps in flat directions and small steps in steep directions. Since we are exploring rugged landscapes where curvatures change, this requires us to keep track of not only the gradient but second derivatives. The ideal scenario would be to calculate the Hessian but this proves to be too computationally expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "* GD can take exponential time to escape saddle points, even with random initialization. As we mentioned, GD is extremely sensitive to initial condition since it determines the particular local minimum GD would eventually reach. However, even with a good initialization scheme, through the introduction of randomness, GD can still take exponential time to escape saddle points."

    "## Memory Usage and Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "A major advantage of SGD is its memory efficiency in handling large\n",
    "datasets. Full-batch GD requires access to the entire training set for\n",
    "each iteration, which often means the whole dataset (or a large\n",
    "subset) must reside in memory to compute $\\nabla C(\\theta)$ . This results\n",
    "in memory usage that scales linearly with the dataset size $N$. For\n",
    "instance, if each training sample is large (e.g. high-dimensional\n",
    "features), computing a full gradient may require storing a substantial\n",
    "portion of the data or all intermediate gradients until they are\n",
    "aggregated. In contrast, SGD needs only a single (or a small\n",
    "mini-batch of) training example(s) in memory at any time . The\n",
    "algorithm processes one sample (or mini-batch) at a time and\n",
    "immediately updates the model, discarding that sample before moving to\n",
    "the next. This streaming approach means that memory footprint is\n",
    "essentially independent of $N$ (apart from storing the model\n",
    "parameters themselves). As one source notes, gradient descent\n",
    "“requires more memory than SGD” because it “must store the entire\n",
    "dataset for each iteration,” whereas SGD “only needs to store the\n",
    "current training example” . In practical terms, if you have a dataset\n",
    "of size, say, 1 million examples, full-batch GD would need memory for\n",
    "all million every step, while SGD could be implemented to load just\n",
    "one example at a time – a crucial benefit if data are too large to fit\n",
    "in RAM or GPU memory. This scalability makes SGD suitable for\n",
    "large-scale learning: as long as you can stream data from disk, SGD\n",
    "can handle arbitrarily large datasets with fixed memory. In fact, SGD\n",
    "“does not need to remember which examples were visited” in the past,\n",
    "allowing it to run in an online fashion on infinite data streams\n",
    ". Full-batch GD, on the other hand, would require multiple passes\n",
    "through a giant dataset per update (or a complex distributed memory\n",
    "system), which is often infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a secondary memory effect: computing a full-batch\n",
    "gradient in deep learning requires storing all intermediate\n",
    "activations for backpropagation across the entire batch. A very large\n",
    "batch (approaching the full dataset) might exhaust GPU memory due to\n",
    "the need to hold activation gradients for thousands or millions of\n",
    "examples simultaneously. SGD/minibatches mitigate this by splitting\n",

    "\n",
    "2. No manual schedule needed: The accumulation $r_t$ keeps increasing (or stays the same if gradient is zero), so step sizes $\\eta/\\sqrt{r_t}$ are non-increasing. This has a similar effect to a learning rate schedule, but individualized per coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sparse data benefit: For very sparse features, $r_{t,j}$ grows slowly, so that feature’s parameter retains a higher learning rate for longer, allowing it to make significant updates when it does get a gradient signal\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Convergence: In convex optimization, AdaGrad can be shown to achieve a sub-linear convergence rate  comparable to the best fixed learning rate tuned for the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "It effectively reduces the need to tune $\\eta$ by hand.\n",
    "1. Limitations: Because $r_t$ accumulates without bound, AdaGrad’s learning rates can become extremely small over long training, potentially slowing progress. (Later variants like RMSProp, AdaDelta, Adam address this by modifying the accumulation rule.)"

    "* **Randomize the data when making mini-batches**. It is always important to randomly shuffle the data when forming mini-batches. Otherwise, the gradient descent method can fit spurious correlations resulting from the order in which data is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transform your inputs**. Learning becomes difficult when our landscape has a mixture of steep and flat directions. One simple trick for minimizing these situations is to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and normalizing the variance of input variables. Whenever possible, also decorrelate the inputs. To understand why this is helpful, consider the case of linear regression. It is easy to show that for the squared error cost function, the Hessian of the cost function is just the correlation matrix between the inputs. Thus, by standardizing the inputs, we are ensuring that the landscape looks homogeneous in all directions in parameter space. Since most deep networks can be viewed as linear transformations followed by a non-linearity at each layer, we expect this intuition to hold beyond the linear case.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Monitor the out-of-sample performance.** Always monitor the performance of your model on a validation set (a small portion of the training data that is held out of the training process to serve as a proxy for the test set. If the validation error starts increasing, then the model is beginning to overfit. Terminate the learning process. This *early stopping* significantly improves performance in many settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adaptive optimization methods don't always have good generalization.** Recent studies have shown that adaptive methods such as ADAM, RMSPorp, and AdaGrad tend to have poor generalization compared to SGD or SGD with momentum, particularly in the high-dimensional limit (i.e. the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points). Although it is not clear at this stage why these methods perform so well in training deep neural networks, simpler procedures like properly-tuned SGD may work as well or better in these applications."

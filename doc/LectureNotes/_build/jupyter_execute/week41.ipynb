    "## The multilayer  perceptron (MLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The multilayer perceptron is a very popular, and easy to implement approach, to deep learning. It consists of\n",
    "1. A neural network with one or more layers of nodes between the input and the output nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The multilayer network structure, or architecture, or topology, consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and one output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The input nodes pass values to the first hidden layer, its nodes pass the information on to the second and so on till we reach the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a convention it is normal to call  a  network with one layer of input units, one layer of hidden\n",
    "units and one layer of output units as  a two-layer network. A network with two layers of hidden units is called a three-layer network etc etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an MLP network there is no direct connection between the output nodes/neurons/units and  the input nodes/neurons/units.\n",
    "Hereafter we will call the various entities of a layer for nodes.\n",
    "There are also no connections within a single layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of input nodes does not need to equal the number of output\n",
    "nodes. This applies also to the hidden layers. Each layer may have its\n",
    "own number of nodes and activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layers have their name from the fact that they are not\n",
    "linked to observables and as we will see below when we define the\n",
    "so-called activation $\\hat{z}$, we can think of this as a basis\n",
    "expansion of the original inputs $\\hat{x}$. The difference however\n",
    "between neural networks and say linear regression is that now these\n",
    "basis functions (which will correspond to the weights in the network)\n",
    "are learned from data. This results in  an important difference between\n",
    "neural networks and deep learning approaches on one side and methods\n",
    "like logistic regression or linear regression and their modifications on the other side."

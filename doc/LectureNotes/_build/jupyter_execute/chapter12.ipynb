    "## Neural Networks vs CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are defined as **affine transformations**, that is \n",
    "a vector is received as input and is multiplied with a matrix of so-called weights (our unknown paramters) to produce an\n",
    "output (to which a bias vector is usually added before passing the result\n",
    "through a nonlinear activation function). This is applicable to any type of input, be it an\n",
    "image, a sound clip or an unordered collection of features: whatever their\n",
    "dimensionality, their representation can always be flattened into a vector\n",
    "before the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we consider images, sound clips and many other similar kinds of data, these data  have an intrinsic\n",
    "structure. More formally, they share these important properties:\n",
    "* They are stored as multi-dimensional arrays (think of the pixels of a figure) .\n",
    "\n",
    "* They feature one or more axes for which ordering matters (e.g., width and height axes for an image, time axis for a sound clip).\n",
    "\n",
    "* One axis, called the channel axis, is used to access different views of the data (e.g., the red, green and blue channels of a color image, or the left and right channels of a stereo audio track).\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties are not exploited when an affine transformation is applied; in\n",
    "fact, all the axes are treated in the same way and the topological information\n",
    "is not taken into account. Still, taking advantage of the implicit structure of\n",
    "the data may prove very handy in solving some tasks, like computer vision and\n",
    "speech recognition, and in these cases it would be best to preserve it. This is\n",
    "where discrete convolutions come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete convolution is a linear transformation that preserves this notion of\n",
    "ordering. It is sparse (only a few input units contribute to a given output\n",
    "unit) and reuses parameters (the same weights are applied to multiple locations\n",
    "in the input).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider\n",
    "an image of size $32\\times 32\\times 3$ (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a\n",
    "single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular\n",
    "Neural Network would have $32\\times 32\\times 3 = 3072$ weights. This amount still\n",
    "seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not\n",
    "scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable\n",
    "size, say $200\\times 200\\times 3$, would lead to neurons that have \n",
    "$200\\times 200\\times 3 = 120,000$ weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could have\n",
    "several such neurons, and the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly,\n",
    "this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters\n",
    "would quickly lead to possible overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN\n",
    "transforms one volume of activations to another through a\n",
    "differentiable function. We use three main types of layers to build\n",
    "CNN architectures: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and\n",
    "Fully-Connected Layer (exactly as seen in regular Neural Networks). We\n",
    "will stack these layers to form a full CNN architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple CNN for image classification could have the architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **INPUT** ($32\\times 32 \\times 3$) will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CONV** (convolutional )layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as $[32\\times 32\\times 12]$ if we decided to use 12 filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RELU** layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the $max(0,x)$ thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged ($[32\\times 32\\times 12]$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **POOL** (pooling) layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as $[16\\times 16\\times 12]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FC** (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size $[1\\times 1\\times 10]$, where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of the MNIST images we considered above . As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs transform the original image layer by layer from the original\n",
    "pixel values to the final class scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that some layers contain\n",
    "parameters and other don’t. In particular, the CNN layers perform\n",
    "transformations that are a function of not only the activations in the\n",
    "input volume, but also of the parameters (the weights and biases of\n",
    "the neurons). On the other hand, the RELU/POOL layers will implement a\n",
    "fixed function. The parameters in the CONV/FC layers will be trained\n",
    "with gradient descent so that the class scores that the CNN computes\n",
    "are consistent with the labels in the training set for each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A CNN architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores)\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each Layer accepts an input 3D volume and transforms it to an output 3D volume through a differentiable function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each Layer may or may not have parameters (e.g. CONV/FC do, RELU/POOL don’t)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each Layer may or may not have additional hyperparameters (e.g. CONV/FC/POOL do, RELU doesn’t)\n",
    "\n",
    "A dense neural network is representd by an affine operation (like matrix-matrix multiplication) where all parameters are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea in CNNs for say imaging is that in images neighbor pixels tend to be related! So we connect\n",
    "only neighboring neurons in the input instead of connecting all with the first hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",

    "Assume furthermore that we have an output layer which is meant to train whether the sound sequence represents a human voice (true) or something else (false).\n",

    "\n",
    "In today’s architecture one can train such neural networks, however\n",
    "this is a huge number of parameters for the task at hand. In general,\n",
    "it is a very wasteful and inefficient use of dense matrices as\n",
    "parameters. Just as importantly, such trained network parameters are\n",

    "## CNNs in more detail, building convolutional neural networks in Tensorflow and Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, CNNs are neural networks built from the assumption that the inputs\n",
    "to the network are 2D images. This is important because the number of features or pixels in images\n",
    "grows very fast with the image size, and an enormous number of weights and biases are needed in order to build an accurate network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we still have our input, a hidden layer and an output. What's novel about convolutional networks\n",
    "are the **convolutional** and **pooling** layers stacked in pairs between the input and the hidden layer.\n",
    "In addition, the data is no longer represented as a 2D feature matrix, instead each input is a number of 2D\n",
    "matrices, typically 1 for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue). \n",
    "\n",
    "It means that to represent the entire\n",
    "dataset of images, we require a 4D matrix or **tensor**. This tensor has the dimensions:"

    "dealing with color images, as most images are, we have an image matrix\n",
    "of size $128\\times 128$ for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue),\n",
    "meaning 3 times the number of weights $= 49152$ are required for every\n",
    "single neuron in the first hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images typically have strong local correlations, meaning that a small\n",
    "part of the image varies little from its neighboring regions. If for\n",
    "example we have an image of a blue car, we can roughly assume that a\n",
    "small blue part of the image is surrounded by other blue regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, instead of connecting every single pixel to a neuron in the\n",
    "first hidden layer, as we have previously done with deep neural\n",
    "networks, we can instead connect each neuron to a small part of the\n",

    "Each filter slides along the input image, taking the dot product\n",
    "between each small part of the image and the filter, in all depth\n",
    "dimensions. This is then passed through a non-linear function,\n",
    "typically the **Rectified Linear (ReLu)** function, which serves as the\n",

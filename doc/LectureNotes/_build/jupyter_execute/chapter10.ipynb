    "Our simple feed-forward neural network will consist of an *input* layer, a single *hidden* layer and an *output* layer. The activation $y$ of each neuron is a weighted sum of inputs, passed through an activation function. In case of the simple perceptron model we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i a_i ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = f(z) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is the activation function, $a_i$ represents input from neuron $i$ in the preceding layer\n",
    "and $w_i$ is the weight to input $i$.  \n",
    "The activation of the neurons in the input layer is just the features (e.g. a pixel value).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest activation function for a neuron is the *Heaviside* function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(z) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1,  &  z > 0\\\\\n",
    "0,  & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A feed-forward neural network with this activation is known as a *perceptron*.  \n",
    "For a binary classifier (i.e. two classes, 0 or 1, dog or not-dog) we can also use this in our output layer.  \n",
    "This activation can be generalized to $k$ classes (using e.g. the *one-against-all* strategy), \n",
    "and we call these architectures *multiclass perceptrons*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is now common to use the terms Single Layer Perceptron (SLP) (1 hidden layer) and  \n",
    "Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (2 or more hidden layers) to refer to feed-forward neural networks with any activation function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Typical choices for activation functions include the sigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent, and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).  \n",

    "* Input \n",

    "\n",
    "* Output\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were building a binary classifier, it would be sufficient with a single neuron in the output layer,\n",
    "which could output 0 or 1 according to the Heaviside function. This would be an example of a *hard* classifier, meaning it outputs the class of the input directly. However, if we are dealing with noisy data it is often beneficial to use a *soft* classifier, which outputs the probability of being in class 0 or 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a soft binary classifier, we could use a single neuron and interpret the output as either being the probability of being in class 0 or the probability of being in class 1. Alternatively we could use 2 neurons, and interpret each neuron as the probability of being in each class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are doing multiclass classification, with 10 categories, it is natural to use 10 neurons in the output layer. We number the neurons $j = 0,1,...,9$. The activation of each output neuron $j$ will be according to the *softmax* function:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{class $j$} \\mid \\text{input $\\hat{a}$}) = \\frac{\\exp{(\\hat{a}^T \\hat{w}_j)}}\n",

    "i.e. each neuron $j$ outputs the probability of being in class $j$ given an input from the hidden layer $\\hat{a}$, with $\\hat{w}_j$ the weights of neuron $j$ to the inputs.  \n",
    "The denominator is a normalization factor to ensure the outputs (probabilities) sum up to 1.  \n",
    "The exponent is just the weighted sum of inputs as before:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_j = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_ {ij} a_i+b_j.$$  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically weights are initialized with small values distributed around zero, drawn from a uniform\n",
    "or normal distribution. Setting all weights to zero means all neurons give the same output, making the network useless.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a bias value to the weighted sum of inputs allows the neural network to represent a greater range\n",
    "of values. Without it, any input with the value 0 will be mapped to zero (before being passed through the activation). The bias unit has an output of 1, and a weight to each neuron $j$, $b_j$:  \n",

    "### Choose cost function and optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure how well our neural network is doing we need to introduce a cost function.  \n",
    "We will call the function that gives the error of a single sample output the *loss* function, and the function\n",
    "that gives the total error of our network across all samples the *cost* function.\n",
    "A typical choice for multiclass classification is the *cross-entropy* loss, also known as the negative log likelihood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In *multiclass* classification it is common to treat each integer label as a so called *one-hot* vector:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = 5 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{y} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = 1 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{y} = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. a binary bit string of length $C$, where $C = 10$ is the number of classes in the MNIST dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y_{ic}$ denote the $c$-th component of the $i$-th one-hot vector.  \n",
    "We define the cost function $\\mathcal{C}$ as a sum over the cross-entropy loss for each point $\\hat{x}_i$ in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the one-hot representation only one of the terms in the loss function is non-zero, namely the\n",
    "probability of the correct category $c'$  \n",
    "(i.e. the category $c'$ such that $y_{ic'} = 1$). This means that the cross entropy loss only punishes you for how wrong\n",
    "you got the correct label. The probability of category $c$ is given by the softmax function. The vector $\\hat{\\theta}$ represents the parameters of our network, i.e. all the weights and biases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizing the cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is trained by finding the weights and biases that minimize the cost function. One of the most widely used classes of methods is *gradient descent* and its generalizations. The idea behind gradient descent\n",
    "is simply to adjust the weights in the direction where the gradient of the cost function is large and negative. This ensures we flow toward a *local* minimum of the cost function.  \n",
    "Each parameter $\\theta$ is iteratively adjusted according to the rule  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta_{i+1} = \\theta_i - \\eta \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta_i) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is known as the *learning rate*, which controls how big a step we take towards the minimum.  \n",
    "This update can be repeated for any number of iterations, or until we are satisfied with the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and effective improvement is a variant called *Batch Gradient Descent*.  \n",
    "Instead of calculating the gradient on the whole dataset, we calculate an approximation of the gradient\n",
    "on a subset of the data called a *minibatch*.  \n",
    "If there are $N$ data points and we have a minibatch size of $M$, the total number of batches\n",
    "is $N/M$.  \n",
    "We denote each minibatch $B_k$, with $k = 1, 2,...,N/M$. The gradient then becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n",
    "\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i \\in B_k} \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. instead of averaging the loss over the entire dataset, we average over a minibatch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This has two important benefits:  \n",
    "1. Introducing stochasticity decreases the chance that the algorithm becomes stuck in a local minima.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It significantly speeds up the calculation, since we do not have to use the entire dataset to calculate the gradient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The various optmization  methods, with codes and algorithms,  are discussed in our lectures on [Gradient descent approaches](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/Splines/html/Splines-bs.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to add an extra term to the cost function, proportional\n",
    "to the size of the weights.  This is equivalent to constraining the\n",
    "size of the weights, so that they do not grow out of control.\n",
    "Constraining the size of the weights means that the weights cannot\n",
    "grow arbitrarily large to fit the training data, and in this way\n",
    "reduces *overfitting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure the size of the weights using the so called *L2-norm*, meaning our cost function becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\mathcal{C}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n",
    "\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) + \\lambda \\lvert \\lvert \\hat{w} \\rvert \\rvert_2^2 \n",
    "= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) + \\lambda \\sum_{ij} w_{ij}^2,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. we sum up all the weights squared. The factor $\\lambda$ is known as a regularization parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the model, we need to calculate the derivative of\n",
    "the cost function with respect to every bias and weight in the\n",
    "network.  In total our network has $(64 + 1)\\times 50=3250$ weights in\n",
    "the hidden layer and $(50 + 1)\\times 10=510$ weights to the output\n",
    "layer ($+1$ for the bias), and the gradient must be calculated for\n",
    "every parameter.  We use the *backpropagation* algorithm discussed\n",
    "above. This is a clever use of the chain rule that allows us to\n",
    "calculate the gradient efficently. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix  multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "To more efficently train our network these equations are implemented using matrix operations.  \n",
    "The error in the output layer is calculated simply as, with $\\hat{t}$ being our targets,  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta_L = \\hat{t} - \\hat{y} = (n_{inputs}, n_{categories}) .$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient for the output weights is calculated as  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla W_{L} = \\hat{a}^T \\delta_L   = (n_{hidden}, n_{categories}) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{a} = (n_{inputs}, n_{hidden})$. This simply means that we are summing up the gradients for each input.  \n",
    "Since we are going backwards we have to transpose the activation matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient with respect to the output bias is then  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla \\hat{b}_{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{inputs}} \\delta_L = (n_{categories}) .$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The error in the hidden layer is  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta_h = \\delta_L W_{L}^T \\circ f'(z_{h}) = \\delta_L W_{L}^T \\circ a_{h} \\circ (1 - a_{h}) = (n_{inputs}, n_{hidden}) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $f'(a_{h})$ is the derivative of the activation in the hidden layer. The matrix products mean\n",
    "that we are summing up the products for each neuron in the output layer. The symbol $\\circ$ denotes\n",
    "the *Hadamard product*, meaning element-wise multiplication.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This again gives us the gradients in the hidden layer:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla W_{h} = X^T \\delta_h = (n_{features}, n_{hidden}) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",

    "The flexibility of neural networks is also one of their main\n",
    "drawbacks: there are many hyperparameters to tweak. Not only can you\n",
    "use any imaginable network topology (how neurons/nodes are interconnected),\n",
    "but even in a simple FFNN you can change the number of layers, the\n",
    "number of neurons per layer, the type of activation function to use in\n",
    "each layer, the weight initialization logic, the stochastic gradient optmized and much more. How do you\n",
    "know what combination of hyperparameters is the best for your task?\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use grid search with cross-validation to find the right hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "However,since there are many hyperparameters to tune, and since\n",
    "training a neural network on a large dataset takes a lot of time, you\n",
    "will only be able to explore a tiny part of the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use randomized search.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Or use tools like [Oscar](http://oscar.calldesk.ai/), which implements more complex algorithms to help you find a good set of hyperparameters quickly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and it will work just fine.\n",
    "For the MNIST data set you ca easily get a high accuracy using just one hidden layer with a\n",
    "few hundred neurons.\n",
    "You can reach for this data set above 98% accuracy using two hidden layers with the same total amount of\n",
    "neurons, in roughly the same amount of training time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more complex problems, you can gradually\n",
    "ramp up the number of hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set. Very complex tasks, such\n",
    "as large image classification or speech recognition, typically require networks with dozens of layers\n",

    "of training data. However, you will rarely have to train such networks from scratch: it is much more\n",

    "gradients to update each parameter with a Gradient Descent (GD) step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately for us, the gradients often get smaller and smaller as the\n",

    "GD update leaves the lower layer connection weights\n",
    "virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good\n",
    "solution. This is known in the literature as \n",
    "**the vanishing gradients problem**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, the opposite can happen, namely the the gradients can grow bigger and\n",
    "bigger. The result is that many of the layers get large updates of the \n",
    "weights the\n",
    "algorithm diverges. This is the **exploding gradients problem**, which is\n",

    "## Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural\n",
    "networks has important limitations. This is especially important when\n",
    "one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like\n",
    "all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or\n",
    "better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few\n",
    "hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random\n",
    "features). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need labeled data**. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems."

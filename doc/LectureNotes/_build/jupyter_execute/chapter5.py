# # Support Vector Machines, overarching aims
# 
# A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful and versatile
# Machine Learning method, capable of performing linear or nonlinear
# classification, regression, and even outlier detection. It is one of
# the most popular models in Machine Learning, and anyone interested in
# Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are
# particularly well suited for classification of complex but small-sized or
# medium-sized datasets.  
# 
# The case with two well-separated classes only can be understood in an
# intuitive way in terms of lines in a two-dimensional space separating
# the two classes (see figure below).
# 
# The basic mathematics behind the SVM is however less familiar to most of us. 
# It relies on the definition of hyperplanes and the
# definition of a **margin** which separates classes (in case of
# classification problems) of variables. It is also used for regression
# problems.
# 
# With SVMs we distinguish between hard margin and soft margins. The
# latter introduces a so-called softening parameter to be discussed
# below.  We distinguish also between linear and non-linear
# approaches. The latter are the most frequent ones since it is rather
# unlikely that we can separate classes easily by say straight lines.
# 
# 
# ## Hyperplanes and all that
# 
# The theory behind support vector machines (SVM hereafter) is based on
# the mathematical description of so-called hyperplanes. Let us start
# with a two-dimensional case. This will also allow us to introduce our
# first SVM examples. These will be tailored to the case of two specific
# classes, as displayed in the figure here based on the usage of the petal data.
# 
# We assume here that our data set can be well separated into two
# domains, where a straight line does the job in the separating the two
# classes. Here the two classes are represented by either squares or
# circles.

# The aim of the SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in a
# $p$-dimensional space, where $p$ is the number of features that
# distinctly classifies the data points.
# 
# In a $p$-dimensional space, a hyperplane is what we call an affine subspace of dimension of $p-1$.
# As an example, in two dimension, a hyperplane is simply as straight line while in three dimensions it is 
# a two-dimensional subspace, or stated simply, a plane. 
# 
# In two dimensions, with the variables $x_1$ and $x_2$, the hyperplane is defined as

# $$
# b+w_1x_1+w_2x_2=0,
# $$

# where $b$ is the intercept and $w_1$ and $w_2$ define the elements of a vector orthogonal to the line 
# $b+w_1x_1+w_2x_2=0$. 
# In two dimensions we define the vectors $\boldsymbol{x} =[x1,x2]$ and $\boldsymbol{w}=[w1,w2]$. 
# We can then rewrite the above equation as

# $$
# \boldsymbol{x}^T\boldsymbol{w}+b=0.
# $$

# We limit ourselves to two classes of outputs $y_i$ and assign these classes the values $y_i = \pm 1$. 
# In a $p$-dimensional space of say $p$ features we have a hyperplane defines as

# $$
# b+wx_1+w_2x_2+\dots +w_px_p=0.
# $$

# If we define a 
# matrix $\boldsymbol{X}=\left[\boldsymbol{x}_1,\boldsymbol{x}_2,\dots, \boldsymbol{x}_p\right]$
# of dimension $n\times p$, where $n$ represents the observations for each feature and each vector $x_i$ is a column vector of the matrix $\boldsymbol{X}$,

# $$
# \boldsymbol{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_{i1} \\ x_{i2} \\ \dots \\ \dots \\ x_{ip} \end{bmatrix}.
# $$

# If the above condition is not met for a given vector $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ we have

# $$
# b+w_1x_{i1}+w_2x_{i2}+\dots +w_px_{ip} >0,
# $$

# if our output $y_i=1$.
# In this case we say that $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ lies on one of the sides of the hyperplane and if

# $$
# b+w_1x_{i1}+w_2x_{i2}+\dots +w_px_{ip} < 0,
# $$

# for the class of observations $y_i=-1$, 
# then $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ lies on the other side. 
# 
# Equivalently, for the two classes of observations we have

# $$
# y_i\left(b+w_1x_{i1}+w_2x_{i2}+\dots +w_px_{ip}\right) > 0.
# $$

# When we try to separate hyperplanes, if it exists, we can use it to construct a natural classifier: a test observation is assigned a given class depending on which side of the hyperplane it is located.
# 
# 
# ### The two-dimensional case
# 
# Let us try to develop our intuition about SVMs by limiting ourselves to a two-dimensional
# plane.  To separate the two classes of data points, there are many
# possible lines (hyperplanes if you prefer a more strict naming)  
# that could be chosen. Our objective is to find a
# plane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between
# data points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance provides
# some reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with
# more confidence.
# 
# What a linear classifier attempts to accomplish is to split the
# feature space into two half spaces by placing a hyperplane between the
# data points.  This hyperplane will be our decision boundary.  All
# points on one side of the plane will belong to class one and all points
# on the other side of the plane will belong to the second class two.
# 
# Unfortunately there are many ways in which we can place a hyperplane
# to divide the data.  Below is an example of two candidate hyperplanes
# for our data sample.
# 
# 
# Let us define the function

# $$
# f(x) = \boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}+b = 0,
# $$

# as the function that determines the line $L$ that separates two classes (our two features), see the figure here. 
# 
# 
# Any point defined by $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{x}_2$ on the line $L$ will satisfy $\boldsymbol{w}^T(\boldsymbol{x}_1-\boldsymbol{x}_2)=0$. 
# 
# The signed distance $\delta$ from any point defined by a vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ and a point $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ on the line $L$ is then

# $$
# \delta = \frac{1}{\vert\vert \boldsymbol{w}\vert\vert}(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}+b).
# $$

# How do we find the parameter $b$ and the vector $\boldsymbol{w}$? What we could
# do is to define a cost function which now contains the set of all
# misclassified points $M$ and attempt to minimize this function

# $$
# C(\boldsymbol{w},b) = -\sum_{i\in M} y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b).
# $$

# We could now for example define all values $y_i =1$ as misclassified in case we have $\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b < 0$ and the opposite if we have $y_i=-1$. Taking the derivatives gives us

# $$
# \frac{\partial C}{\partial b} = -\sum_{i\in M} y_i,
# $$

# and

# $$
# \frac{\partial C}{\partial \boldsymbol{w}} = -\sum_{i\in M} y_ix_i.
# $$

# We can now use the Newton-Raphson method or different variants of the gradient descent family (from plain gradient descent to various stochastic gradient descent approaches) to solve the equations

# $$
# b \leftarrow b +\eta \frac{\partial C}{\partial b},
# $$

# and

# $$
# \boldsymbol{w} \leftarrow \boldsymbol{w} +\eta \frac{\partial C}{\partial \boldsymbol{w}},
# $$

# where $\eta$ is our by now well-known learning rate. 
# 
# 
# 
# The equations we discussed above can be coded rather easily (the
# framework is similar to what we developed for logistic
# regression). We are going to set up a simple case with two classes only and we want to find a line which separates them the best possible way.

# There are however problems with this approach, although it looks
# pretty straightforward to implement. When running the above code, we see that we can easily end up with many diffeent lines which separate the two classes.
# 
# 
# For small
# gaps between the entries, we may also end up needing many iterations
# before the solutions converge and if the data cannot be separated
# properly into two distinct classes, we may not experience a converge
# at all.
# 
# 
# ### A better approach
# 
# A better approach is rather to try to define a large margin between
# the two classes (if they are well separated from the beginning).
# 
# Thus, we wish to find a margin $M$ with $\boldsymbol{w}$ normalized to
# $\vert\vert \boldsymbol{w}\vert\vert =1$ subject to the condition

# $$
# y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b) \geq M \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i=1,2,\dots, p.
# $$

# All points are thus at a signed distance from the decision boundary defined by the line $L$. The parameters $b$ and $w_1$ and $w_2$ define this line. 
# 
# We seek thus the largest value $M$ defined by

# $$
# \frac{1}{\vert \vert \boldsymbol{w}\vert\vert}y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b) \geq M \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i=1,2,\dots, n,
# $$

# or just

# $$
# y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b) \geq M\vert \vert \boldsymbol{w}\vert\vert \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i.
# $$

# If we scale the equation so that $\vert \vert \boldsymbol{w}\vert\vert = 1/M$, we have to find the minimum of 
# $\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{w}=\vert \vert \boldsymbol{w}\vert\vert$ (the norm) subject to the condition

# $$
# y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b) \geq 1 \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i.
# $$

# We have thus defined our margin as the invers of the norm of
# $\boldsymbol{w}$. We want to minimize the norm in order to have a as large as
# possible margin $M$. Before we proceed, we need to remind ourselves
# about Lagrangian multipliers.
# 
# 
# ## A quick Reminder on Lagrangian Multipliers
# 
# Consider a function of three independent variables $f(x,y,z)$ . For the function $f$ to be an
# extreme we have

# $$
# df=0.
# $$

# A necessary and sufficient condition is

# $$
# \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}=0,
# $$

# due to

# $$
# df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz.
# $$

# In many problems the variables $x,y,z$ are often subject to constraints (such as those above for the margin)
# so that they are no longer all independent. It is possible at least in principle to use each 
# constraint to eliminate one variable
# and to proceed with a new and smaller set of independent varables.
# 
# The use of so-called Lagrangian  multipliers is an alternative technique  when the elimination
# of variables is incovenient or undesirable.  Assume that we have an equation of constraint on 
# the variables $x,y,z$

# $$
# \phi(x,y,z) = 0,
# $$

# resulting in

# $$
# d\phi = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}dz =0.
# $$

# Now we cannot set anymore

# $$
# \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}=0,
# $$

# if $df=0$ is wanted
# because there are now only two independent variables!  Assume $x$ and $y$ are the independent 
# variables.
# Then $dz$ is no longer arbitrary.
# 
# 
# However, we can add to

# $$
# df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz,
# $$

# a multiplum of $d\phi$, viz. $\lambda d\phi$, resulting  in

# $$
# df+\lambda d\phi = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}+\lambda
# \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x})dx+(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}+\lambda\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y})dy+
# (\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}+\lambda\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z})dz =0.
# $$

# Our multiplier is chosen so that

# $$
# \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}+\lambda\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} =0.
# $$

# We need to remember that we took $dx$ and $dy$ to be arbitrary and thus we must have

# $$
# \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+\lambda\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} =0,
# $$

# and

# $$
# \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}+\lambda\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} =0.
# $$

# When all these equations are satisfied, $df=0$.  We have four unknowns, $x,y,z$ and
# $\lambda$. Actually we want only $x,y,z$, $\lambda$ needs not to be determined, 
# it is therefore often called
# Lagrange's undetermined multiplier.
# If we have a set of constraints $\phi_k$ we have the equations

# $$
# \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}+\sum_k\lambda_k\frac{\partial \phi_k}{\partial x_i} =0.
# $$

# In order to solve the above problem, we define the following Lagrangian function to be minimized

# $$
# \cal{L}(\lambda,b,\boldsymbol{w})=\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{w}-\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i\left[y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b)-1\right],
# $$

# where $\lambda_i$ is a so-called Lagrange multiplier subject to the condition $\lambda_i \geq 0$.
# 
# Taking the derivatives  with respect to $b$ and $\boldsymbol{w}$ we obtain

# $$
# \frac{\partial \cal{L}}{\partial b} = -\sum_{i} \lambda_iy_i=0,
# $$

# and

# $$
# \frac{\partial \cal{L}}{\partial \boldsymbol{w}} = 0 = \boldsymbol{w}-\sum_{i} \lambda_iy_i\boldsymbol{x}_i.
# $$

# Inserting these constraints into the equation for $\cal{L}$ we obtain

# $$
# \cal{L}=\sum_i\lambda_i-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}^n\lambda_i\lambda_jy_iy_j\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{x}_j,
# $$

# subject to the constraints $\lambda_i\geq 0$ and $\sum_i\lambda_iy_i=0$. 
# We must in addition satisfy the [Karush-Kuhn-Tucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions) (KKT) condition

# $$
# \lambda_i\left[y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b) -1\right] \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i.
# $$

# 1. If $\lambda_i > 0$, then $y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b)=1$ and we say that $x_i$ is on the boundary.
# 
# 2. If $y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b)> 1$, we say $x_i$ is not on the boundary and we set $\lambda_i=0$. 
# 
# When $\lambda_i > 0$, the vectors $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ are called support vectors. They are the vectors closest to the line (or hyperplane) and define the margin $M$. 
# 
# 
# We can rewrite

# $$
# \cal{L}=\sum_i\lambda_i-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}^n\lambda_i\lambda_jy_iy_j\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{x}_j,
# $$

# and its constraints in terms of a matrix-vector problem where we minimize w.r.t. $\lambda$ the following problem

# $$
# \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\lambda}^T\begin{bmatrix} y_1y_1\boldsymbol{x}_1^T\boldsymbol{x}_1 & y_1y_2\boldsymbol{x}_1^T\boldsymbol{x}_2 & \dots & \dots & y_1y_n\boldsymbol{x}_1^T\boldsymbol{x}_n \\
# y_2y_1\boldsymbol{x}_2^T\boldsymbol{x}_1 & y_2y_2\boldsymbol{x}_2^T\boldsymbol{x}_2 & \dots & \dots & y_1y_n\boldsymbol{x}_2^T\boldsymbol{x}_n \\
# \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
# \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
# y_ny_1\boldsymbol{x}_n^T\boldsymbol{x}_1 & y_ny_2\boldsymbol{x}_n^T\boldsymbol{x}_2 & \dots & \dots & y_ny_n\boldsymbol{x}_n^T\boldsymbol{x}_n \\
# \end{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{\lambda}-\mathbb{1}\boldsymbol{\lambda},
# $$

# subject to $\boldsymbol{y}^T\boldsymbol{\lambda}=0$. Here we defined the vectors $\boldsymbol{\lambda} =[\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_n]$ and 
# $\boldsymbol{y}=[y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n]$. 
# 
# 
# 
# Solving the above problem, yields the values of $\lambda_i$.
# To find the coefficients of your hyperplane we need simply to compute

# $$
# \boldsymbol{w}=\sum_{i} \lambda_iy_i\boldsymbol{x}_i.
# $$

# With our vector $\boldsymbol{w}$ we can in turn find the value of the intercept $b$ (here in two dimensions) via

# $$
# y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b)=1,
# $$

# resulting in

# $$
# b = \frac{1}{y_i}-\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i,
# $$

# or if we write it out in terms of the support vectors only, with $N_s$ being their number,  we have

# $$
# b = \frac{1}{N_s}\sum_{j\in N_s}\left(y_j-\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_iy_i\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{x}_j\right).
# $$

# With our hyperplane coefficients we can use our classifier to assign any observation by simply using

# $$
# y_i = \mathrm{sign}(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b).
# $$

# Below we discuss how to find the optimal values of $\lambda_i$. Before we proceed however, we discuss now the so-called soft classifier. 
# 
# 
# ## A soft classifier
# 
# Till now, the margin is strictly defined by the support vectors. This defines what is called a hard classifier, that is the margins are well defined.
# 
# Suppose now that classes overlap in feature space, as shown in the
# figure here. One way to deal with this problem before we define the
# so-called **kernel approach**, is to allow a kind of slack in the sense
# that we allow some points to be on the wrong side of the margin.
# 
# We introduce thus the so-called **slack** variables $\boldsymbol{\xi} =[\xi_1,x_2,\dots,x_n]$ and 
# modify our previous equation

# $$
# y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b)=1,
# $$

# to

# $$
# y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b)=1-\xi_i,
# $$

# with the requirement $\xi_i\geq 0$. The total violation is now $\sum_i\xi$. 
# The value $\xi_i$ in the constraint the last constraint corresponds to the  amount by which the prediction
# $y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b)=1$ is on the wrong side of its margin. Hence by bounding the sum $\sum_i \xi_i$,
# we bound the total amount by which predictions fall on the wrong side of their margins.
# 
# Misclassifications occur when $\xi_i > 1$. Thus bounding the total sum by some value $C$ bounds in turn the total number of
# misclassifications.
# 
# 
# This has in turn the consequences that we change our optmization problem to finding the minimum of

# $$
# \cal{L}=\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{w}-\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i\left[y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b)-(1-\xi_)\right]+C\sum_{i=1}^n\xi_i-\sum_{i=1}^n\gamma_i\xi_i,
# $$

# subject to

# $$
# y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b)=1-\xi_i \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i,
# $$

# with the requirement $\xi_i\geq 0$.
# 
# Taking the derivatives  with respect to $b$ and $\boldsymbol{w}$ we obtain

# $$
# \frac{\partial \cal{L}}{\partial b} = -\sum_{i} \lambda_iy_i=0,
# $$

# and

# $$
# \frac{\partial \cal{L}}{\partial \boldsymbol{w}} = 0 = \boldsymbol{w}-\sum_{i} \lambda_iy_i\boldsymbol{x}_i,
# $$

# and

# $$
# \lambda_i = C-\gamma_i \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i.
# $$

# Inserting these constraints into the equation for $\cal{L}$ we obtain the same equation as before

# $$
# \cal{L}=\sum_i\lambda_i-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}^n\lambda_i\lambda_jy_iy_j\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{x}_j,
# $$

# but now subject to the constraints $\lambda_i\geq 0$, $\sum_i\lambda_iy_i=0$ and $0\leq\lambda_i \leq C$. 
# We must in addition satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition which now reads

# 5
# 0
#  
# <
# <
# <
# !
# !
# M
# A
# T
# H
# _
# B
# L
# O
# C
# K

# $$
# \gamma_i\xi_i = 0,
# $$

# and

# $$
# y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{x}_i+b) -(1-\xi_) \geq 0 \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i.
# $$

# ## Kernels and non-linearity
# 
# The cases we have studied till now, were all characterized by two classes
# with a close to linear separability. The classifiers we have described
# so far find linear boundaries in our input feature space. It is
# possible to make our procedure more flexible by exploring the feature
# space using other basis expansions such as higher-order polynomials,
# wavelets, splines etc.
# 
# If our feature space is not easy to separate, as shown in the figure
# here, we can achieve a better separation by introducing more complex
# basis functions. The ideal would be, as shown in the next figure, to, via a specific transformation to 
# obtain a separation between the classes which is almost linear. 
# 
# The change of basis, from $x\rightarrow z=\phi(x)$ leads to the same type of equations to be solved, except that
# we need to introduce for example a polynomial transformation to a two-dimensional training set.

# Suppose we define a polynomial transformation of degree two only (we continue to live in a plane with $x_i$ and $y_i$ as variables)

# $$
# z = \phi(x_i) =\left(x_i^2, y_i^2, \sqrt{2}x_iy_i\right).
# $$

# With our new basis, the equations we solved earlier are basically the same, that is we have now (without the slack option for simplicity)

# $$
# \cal{L}=\sum_i\lambda_i-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}^n\lambda_i\lambda_jy_iy_j\boldsymbol{z}_i^T\boldsymbol{z}_j,
# $$

# subject to the constraints $\lambda_i\geq 0$, $\sum_i\lambda_iy_i=0$, and for the support vectors

# $$
# y_i(\boldsymbol{w}^T\boldsymbol{z}_i+b)= 1 \hspace{0.1cm}\forall i,
# $$

# from which we also find $b$.
# To compute $\boldsymbol{z}_i^T\boldsymbol{z}_j$ we define the kernel $K(\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol{x}_j)$ as

# $$
# K(\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol{x}_j)=\boldsymbol{z}_i^T\boldsymbol{z}_j= \phi(\boldsymbol{x}_i)^T\phi(\boldsymbol{x}_j).
# $$

# For the above example, the kernel reads

# $$
# K(\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol{x}_j)=[x_i^2, y_i^2, \sqrt{2}x_iy_i]^T\begin{bmatrix} x_j^2 \\ y_j^2 \\ \sqrt{2}x_jy_j \end{bmatrix}=x_i^2x_j^2+2x_ix_jy_iy_j+y_i^2y_j^2.
# $$

# We note that this is nothing but the dot product of the two original
# vectors $(\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{x}_j)^2$. Instead of thus computing the
# product in the Lagrangian of $\boldsymbol{z}_i^T\boldsymbol{z}_j$ we simply compute
# the dot product $(\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{x}_j)^2$.
# 
# 
# This leads to the so-called
# kernel trick and the result leads to the same as if we went through
# the trouble of performing the transformation
# $\phi(\boldsymbol{x}_i)^T\phi(\boldsymbol{x}_j)$ during the SVM calculations.
# 
# 
# 
# Using our definition of the kernel We can rewrite again the Lagrangian

# $$
# \cal{L}=\sum_i\lambda_i-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}^n\lambda_i\lambda_jy_iy_j\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{z}_j,
# $$

# subject to the constraints $\lambda_i\geq 0$, $\sum_i\lambda_iy_i=0$ in terms of a convex optimization problem

# $$
# \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\lambda}^T\begin{bmatrix} y_1y_1K(\boldsymbol{x}_1,\boldsymbol{x}_1) & y_1y_2K(\boldsymbol{x}_1,\boldsymbol{x}_2) & \dots & \dots & y_1y_nK(\boldsymbol{x}_1,\boldsymbol{x}_n) \\
# y_2y_1K(\boldsymbol{x}_2,\boldsymbol{x}_1) & y_2y_2(\boldsymbol{x}_2,\boldsymbol{x}_2) & \dots & \dots & y_1y_nK(\boldsymbol{x}_2,\boldsymbol{x}_n) \\

# \end{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{\lambda}-\mathbb{1}\boldsymbol{\lambda},
# $$

# subject to $\boldsymbol{y}^T\boldsymbol{\lambda}=0$. Here we defined the vectors $\boldsymbol{\lambda} =[\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_n]$ and 
# $\boldsymbol{y}=[y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n]$. 
# If we add the slack constants this leads to the additional constraint $0\leq \lambda_i \leq C$.
# 
# We can rewrite this (see the solutions below) in terms of a convex optimization problem of the type

# $$
# \begin{align*}
#     &\mathrm{min}_{\lambda}\hspace{0.2cm} \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\lambda}^T\boldsymbol{P}\boldsymbol{\lambda}+\boldsymbol{q}^T\boldsymbol{\lambda},\\ \nonumber
#     &\mathrm{subject\hspace{0.1cm}to} \hspace{0.2cm} \boldsymbol{G}\boldsymbol{\lambda} \preceq \boldsymbol{h} \hspace{0.2cm} \wedge \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{\lambda}=f.
# \end{align*}
# $$

# Below we discuss how to solve these equations. Here we note that the matrix $\boldsymbol{P}$ has matrix elements $p_{ij}=y_iy_jK(\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol{x}_j)$.
# Given a kernel $K$ and the targets $y_i$ this matrix is easy to set up. The constraint $\boldsymbol{y}^T\boldsymbol{\lambda}=0$ leads to $f=0$ and $\boldsymbol{A}=\boldsymbol{y}$. How to set up the matrix $\boldsymbol{G}$ is discussed later. Here note that the inequalities $0\leq \lambda_i \leq C$ can be split up into
# $0\leq \lambda_i$ and $\lambda_i \leq C$. These two inequalities define then the matrix $\boldsymbol{G}$ and the vector $\boldsymbol{h}$.
# 
# 
# 
# ## Different kernels and Mercer's theorem
# 
# There are several popular kernels being used. These are
# 1. Linear: $K(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})=\boldsymbol{x}^T\boldsymbol{y}$,
# 
# 2. Polynomial: $K(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})=(\boldsymbol{x}^T\boldsymbol{y}+\gamma)^d$,
# 
# 3. Gaussian Radial Basis Function: $K(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})=\exp{\left(-\gamma\vert\vert\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{y}\vert\vert^2\right)}$,
# 
# 4. Tanh: $K(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})=\tanh{(\boldsymbol{x}^T\boldsymbol{y}+\gamma)}$,
# 
# and many other ones.
# 
# An important theorem for us is [Mercer's
# theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer%27s_theorem).  The
# theorem states that if a kernel function $K$ is symmetric, continuous
# and leads to a positive semi-definite matrix $\boldsymbol{P}$ then there
# exists a function $\phi$ that maps $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{x}_j$ into
# another space (possibly with much higher dimensions) such that

# $$
# K(\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol{x}_j)=\phi(\boldsymbol{x}_i)^T\phi(\boldsymbol{x}_j).
# $$

# So you can use $K$ as a kernel since you know $\phi$ exists, even if
# you don’t know what $\phi$ is. 
# 
# Note that some frequently used kernels (such as the Sigmoid kernel)
# don’t respect all of Mercer’s conditions, yet they generally work well
# in practice.

# ## Mathematical optimization of convex functions
# 
# A mathematical (quadratic) optimization problem, or just optimization problem, has the form

# $$
# \begin{align*}
#     &\mathrm{min}_{\lambda}\hspace{0.2cm} \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\lambda}^T\boldsymbol{P}\boldsymbol{\lambda}+\boldsymbol{q}^T\boldsymbol{\lambda},\\ \nonumber
#     &\mathrm{subject\hspace{0.1cm}to} \hspace{0.2cm} \boldsymbol{G}\boldsymbol{\lambda} \preceq \boldsymbol{h} \wedge  \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{\lambda}=f.
# \end{align*}
# $$

# subject to some constraints for say a selected set $i=1,2,\dots, n$.
# In our case we are optimizing with respect to the Lagrangian multipliers $\lambda_i$, and the
# vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}=[\lambda_1, \lambda_2,\dots, \lambda_n]$ is the optimization variable we are dealing with.
# 
# In our case we are particularly interested in a class of optimization problems called convex optmization problems. 
# In our discussion on gradient descent methods we discussed at length the definition of a convex function. 
# 
# Convex optimization problems play a central role in applied mathematics and we recommend strongly [Boyd and Vandenberghe's text on the topics](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/).
# 
# 
# 
# 
# If we use Python as programming language and wish to venture beyond
# **scikit-learn**, **tensorflow** and similar software which makes our
# lives so much easier, we need to dive into the wonderful world of
# quadratic programming. We can, if we wish, solve the minimization
# problem using say standard gradient methods or conjugate gradient
# methods. However, these methods tend to exhibit a rather slow
# converge. So, welcome to the promised land of quadratic programming.
# 
# The functions we need are contained in the quadratic programming package **CVXOPT** and we need to import it together with **numpy** as

# In[4]:


import numpy
import cvxopt


# This will make our life much easier. You don't need t write your own optimizer.
# 
# 
# 
# We remind ourselves about the general problem we want to solve

# $$
# \begin{align*}
#     &\mathrm{min}_{x}\hspace{0.2cm} \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{x}^T\boldsymbol{P}\boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{q}^T\boldsymbol{x},\\ \nonumber
#     &\mathrm{subject\hspace{0.1cm} to} \hspace{0.2cm} \boldsymbol{G}\boldsymbol{x} \preceq \boldsymbol{h} \wedge  \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}=f.
# \end{align*}
# $$

# Let us show how to perform the optmization using a simple case. Assume we want to optimize the following problem

# $$
# \begin{align*}
#     &\mathrm{min}_{x}\hspace{0.2cm} \frac{1}{2}x^2+5x+3y \\ \nonumber
#     &\mathrm{subject to} \\ \nonumber
#     &x, y \geq 0 \\ \nonumber
#     &x+3y  \geq 15 \\ \nonumber
#     &2x+5y  \leq  100 \\ \nonumber
#     &3x+4y  \leq  80.  \\ \nonumber
# \end{align*}
# $$

# The minimization problem can be rewritten in terms of vectors and matrices as (with $x$ and $y$ being the unknowns)

# $$
# \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} x\\ y \end{bmatrix}^T   \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0  \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}  + \begin{bmatrix}3\\ 4  \end{bmatrix}^T \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y  \end{bmatrix}.
# $$

# Similarly, we can now set up the inequalities (we need to change $\geq$ to $\leq$ by multiplying with $-1$ on bot sides) as the following matrix-vector equation

# $$
# \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \\ -1 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \\ 3 & 4\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y\end{bmatrix} \preceq \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0\\ -15 \\ 100 \\ 80\end{bmatrix}.
# $$

# We have collapsed all the inequalities into a single matrix $\boldsymbol{G}$. We see also that our matrix

# $$
# \boldsymbol{P} =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0  \end{bmatrix}
# $$

# is clearly positive semi-definite (all eigenvalues larger or equal zero). 
# Finally, the vector $\boldsymbol{h}$ is defined as

# $$
# \boldsymbol{h} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0\\ -15 \\ 100 \\ 80\end{bmatrix}.
# $$

# Since we don't have any equalities the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ is set to zero
# The following code solves the equations for us

# In[ ]:


# Import the necessary packages
import numpy
from cvxopt import matrix
from cvxopt import solvers

# We are now ready to return to our setup of the optmization problem for a more realistic case. Introducing the **slack** parameter $C$ we have

# \end{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{\lambda}-\mathbb{I}\boldsymbol{\lambda},
# $$

# subject to $\boldsymbol{y}^T\boldsymbol{\lambda}=0$. Here we defined the vectors $\boldsymbol{\lambda} =[\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_n]$ and 
# $\boldsymbol{y}=[y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n]$. 
# With  the slack constants this leads to the additional constraint $0\leq \lambda_i \leq C$.

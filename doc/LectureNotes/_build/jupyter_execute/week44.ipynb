    "\n",
    "Here we present a flexible and readable python code for a CNN\n",
    "implemented with NumPy. We will present the code, showcase how to use\n",
    "the codebase and fit a CNN that yields a 99% accuracy on the 28x28\n",
    "MNIST dataset within reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN is compatible with all schedulers, cost functions and\n",
    "activation functions discussed in constructing our neural network\n",
    "codes.\n",
    "\n",
    " The CNN code consists of different types of Layer classes, including\n",
    "Convolution2DLayer, Pooling2DLayer, FlattenLayer, FullyConnectedLayer\n",
    "and OutputLayer, which can be added to the CNN object using the\n",
    "interface of the CNN class. This allows you to easily construct your\n",
    "own CNN, as well as allowing you to get used to an interface similar\n",
    "to that of TensorFlow which is used for real world applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important feature of this code is that it throws errors if\n",
    "unreasonable decisions are made (for example using a kernel that is\n",
    "larger than the image, not using a FlattenLayer, etc), and provides\n",
    "the user with an informative error message."

    "\n",
    "After establishing the foundational understanding of applying\n",

    "primary function of convolution, as previously discussed, is to\n",
    "extract pertinent information from images while simultaneously\n",

    "shall begin by partitioning the images into color channels (unless the\n",
    "image is grayscale), comprising three primary colors: red, green, and\n",
    "blue. We will subsequently utilize trainable kernels to construct a\n",
    "higher-dimensional encoding of each channel called feature\n",
    "maps. Successive layers will receive these feature maps as inputs,\n",
    "generating further encodings, albeit with reduced dimensions. The term\n",

    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed during the last\n",

    "tasks. Nowadays, CNNs are a central element in the spectacular success\n",

    "structure. More formally, they share these important properties:\n",
    "* They are stored as multi-dimensional arrays (think of the pixels of a figure) .\n",

    "\n",
    "After establishing the foundational understanding of applying\n",

    "of a convolutional layer in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The\n",
    "primary function of convolution, as previously discussed, is to\n",

    "decreasing the scale of our data. To initiate the image processing, we\n",
    "shall begin by partitioning the images into color channels (unless the\n",
    "image is grayscale), comprising three primary colors: red, green, and\n",
    "blue. We will subsequently utilize trainable kernels to construct a\n",
    "higher-dimensional encoding of each channel called feature\n",
    "maps. Successive layers will receive these feature maps as inputs,\n",
    "generating further encodings, albeit with reduced dimensions. The term\n",
    "trainable kernels denotes the initialization of pre-defined\n",
    "kernel-shaped weights, which we will then train via backpropagation,\n",
    "similar to how weights are trained in a Feedforward Neural Network.\n",

    "To ensure seamless integration between our implementation of the\n",

    "incorporate our implementation into their existing machine learning\n",
    "pipelines without having to make significant changes to their\n",

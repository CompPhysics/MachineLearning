    "The aim of the exercises this week is to train the neural network you implemented last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train neural networks, we use gradient descent, since there is no analytical expression for the optimal parameters. This means you will need to compute the gradient of the cost function wrt. the network parameters. And then you will need to implement some gradient method.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will begin by computing gradients for a network with one layer, then two layers, then any number of layers. Keeping track of the shapes and doing things step by step will be very important this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that you do the exercises this week by editing and running this notebook file, as it includes some checks along the way that you have implemented the neural network correctly, and running small parts of the code at a time will be important for understanding the methods. If you have trouble running a notebook, you can run this notebook in google colab instead(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FfvbN0XlhV-lATRPyGRTtTBnJr3zNuHL#offline=true&sandboxMode=true), though we recommend that you set up VSCode and your python environment to run code like this locally.\n",

    "Passing in the layers, activations functions, activation derivatives and cost derivatives into the functions each time leads to code which is easy to understand in isoloation, but messier when used in a larger context with data splitting, data scaling, gradient methods and so forth. Creating an object which stores these values can lead to code which is much easier to use.\n",

    "**a)** Write a neural network class. You are free to implement it how you see fit, though we strongly recommend to not save any input or output values as class attributes, nor let the neural network class handle gradient methods internally. Gradient methods should be handled outside, by performing general operations on the layer_grads list using functions or classes separate to the neural network.\n",

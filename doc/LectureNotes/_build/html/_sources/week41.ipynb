    "## Optimizing the cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is trained by finding the weights and biases that minimize the cost function. One of the most widely used classes of methods is *gradient descent* and its generalizations. The idea behind gradient descent\n",
    "is simply to adjust the weights in the direction where the gradient of the cost function is large and negative. This ensures we flow toward a *local* minimum of the cost function.  \n",

    "$$ \\theta_{i+1} = \\theta_i - \\eta \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta_i) ,$$\n",

    "Instead of calculating the gradient on the whole dataset, we calculate an approximation of the gradient\n",

    "If there are $N$ data points and we have a minibatch size of $M$, the total number of batches\n",

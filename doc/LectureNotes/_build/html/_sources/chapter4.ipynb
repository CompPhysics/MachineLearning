    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression our main interest was centered on learning the\n",
    "coefficients of a functional fit (say a polynomial) in order to be\n",
    "able to predict the response of a continuous variable on some unseen\n",
    "data. The fit to the continuous variable $y_i$ is based on some\n",
    "independent variables $x_i$. Linear regression resulted in\n",
    "analytical expressions for standard ordinary Least Squares or Ridge\n",
    "regression (in terms of matrices to invert) for several quantities,\n",
    "ranging from the variance and thereby the confidence intervals of the\n",
    "optimal parameters $\\hat{\\beta}$ to the mean squared error. If we can invert\n",
    "the product of the design matrices, linear regression gives then a\n",
    "simple recipe for fitting our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification problems, however, are concerned with outcomes taking\n",
    "the form of discrete variables (i.e. categories). We may for example,\n",
    "on the basis of DNA sequencing for a number of patients, like to find\n",
    "out which mutations are important for a certain disease; or based on\n",
    "scans of various patients' brains, figure out if there is a tumor or\n",
    "not; or given a specific physical system, we'd like to identify its\n",
    "state, say whether it is an ordered or disordered system (typical\n",
    "situation in solid state physics); or classify the status of a\n",
    "patient, whether she/he has a stroke or not and many other similar\n",
    "situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common situation we encounter when we apply logistic\n",
    "regression is that of two possible outcomes, normally denoted as a\n",
    "binary outcome, true or false, positive or negative, success or\n",
    "failure etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression will also serve as our stepping stone towards\n",
    "neural network algorithms and supervised deep learning. For logistic\n",
    "learning, the minimization of the cost function leads to a non-linear\n",
    "equation in the parameters $\\hat{\\beta}$. The optimization of the\n",
    "problem calls therefore for minimization algorithms. This forms the\n",
    "bottle neck of all machine learning algorithms, namely how to find\n",
    "reliable minima of a multi-variable function. This leads us to the\n",
    "family of gradient descent methods. The latter are the working horses\n",
    "of basically all modern machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note also that many of the topics discussed here on logistic \n",
    "regression are also commonly used in modern supervised Deep Learning\n",
    "models, as we will see later."

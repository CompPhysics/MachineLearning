    "Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern\n",
    "statistics. They involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training\n",
    "set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to\n",
    "obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in\n",
    "order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can\n",
    "repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear\n",
    "regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which\n",
    "the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain\n",
    "information that would not be available from fitting the model only\n",
    "once using the original training sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two resampling methods are often used in Machine Learning analyses,\n",

    "2. and **Cross-Validation**\n",

    "## Resampling methods: Bootstrap\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a [non-parametric approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics) to statistical inference\n",
    "that substitutes computation for more traditional distributional\n",
    "assumptions and asymptotic results. Bootstrapping offers a number of\n",
    "advantages: \n",
    "1. The bootstrap is quite general, although there are some cases in which it fails.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because it does not require distributional assumptions (such as normally distributed errors), the bootstrap can provide more accurate inferences when the data are not well behaved or when the sample size is small.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is possible to apply the bootstrap to statistics with sampling distributions that are difficult to derive, even asymptotically. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is relatively simple to apply the bootstrap to complex data-collection plans (such as stratified and clustered samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "The textbook by [Davison on the Bootstrap Methods and their Applications](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bootstrap-methods-and-their-application/ED2FD043579F27952363566DC09CBD6A) provides many more insights and proofs. In this course we will take a more practical approach and use the results and theorems provided in the literature. For those interested in reading more about the bootstrap methods, we recommend the above text and the one by [Efron and Tibshirani](https://www.routledge.com/An-Introduction-to-the-Bootstrap/Efron-Tibshirani/p/book/9780412042317)."

    "nonlinear functions. The plot shows the function that we want to approximate,\n",
    "which is a part of the cosine function. In addition, the samples from the\n",

    "models have polynomial features of different degrees. We can see that a\n",
    "linear function (polynomial with degree 1) is not sufficient to fit the\n",
    "training samples. This is called **underfitting**. A polynomial of degree 4\n",
    "approximates the true function almost perfectly. However, for higher degrees\n",
    "the model will **overfit** the training data, i.e. it learns the noise of the\n",

    "We evaluate quantitatively overfitting and underfitting by using\n",
    "cross-validation. We calculate the mean squared error (MSE) on the validation\n",

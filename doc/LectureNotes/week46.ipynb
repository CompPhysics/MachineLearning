    "\n",
    "* Unbalanced datasets where some target feature values occur much more frequently than others may lead to biased trees since the frequently occurring feature values are preferred over the less frequently occurring ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number of features is relatively large (high dimensional) and the number of instances is relatively low, the tree might overfit the data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Features with many levels may be preferred over features with less levels since for them it is *more easy* to split the dataset such that the sub datasets only contain pure target feature values. This issue can be addressed by preferring for instance the information gain ratio as splitting criteria over information gain\n",

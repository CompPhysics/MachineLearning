    "## Defining the data sets to analyze yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "For project 3, you can propose own data sets that relate to your research interests or just use existing data sets from say\n",
    "1. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The [University of California at Irvine (UCI) with its  machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Or other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Or you can propose own problems (but please do write to us before you start)\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to the analysis of these new data sets should follow to a large extent what you did in projects 1 and 2. That is:\n",
    "1. Whether you end up with a regression or a classification problem, you should employ at least two of the methods we have discussed among **linear regression (including Ridge and Lasso)**, **Logistic Regression**, **Neural Networks**, **Convolution Neural Networks**, **Recurrent Neural Networks**, and **Decision Trees, Random Forests, Bagging and Boosting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel also free to use support vector machines, $k$-means and principal components analysis, although the latter have not been covered during the lectures. This material can be found in the lecture notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could for example explore  all of the approaches from decision trees, via bagging and voting classifiers, to random forests, boosting and finally XGboost. If you wish to venture into **convolutional neural networks** or **recurrent neural networks**, or extensions of neural networkds, feel free to do so. You can also study unsupervised methods, although we in this course have mainly paid attention to supervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Boosting, feel also free to write your own codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For project 3, you should feel free to use your own codes from projects 1 and 2, eventually write your own for Decision trees/random forests/bagging/boosting' or use the available functionality of **Scikit-Learn**, **Tensorflow**, PyTorch etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The estimates you used and tested in projects 1 and 2 should also be included, that is the $R2$-score, **MSE**, confusion matrix, accuracy score, information gain,  ROC and Cumulative gains curves and other, cross-validation and/or bootstrap if these are relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Similarly, feel free to explore various activations functions in deep learning and various approachs to stochastic gradient descent approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If possible, you should link the data sets with exisiting research and analyses thereof. Scientific articles which have used Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the data are highly welcome. Perhaps you can improve previous analyses and even publish a new article? \n",
    "\n",
    "5. A critical assessment of the methods with ditto perspectives and recommendations is also something you need to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, the report should follow the same pattern as the two previous ones, with abstract, introduction, methods, code, results, conclusions etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose also an alternative to the above. This is a project on\n",
    "using machine learning methods (neural networks mainly) to the\n",

    "equations, with a final twist on how to diagonalize a symmetric matrix\n",

We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.\n",

You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did. Here you could also record  the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested or other topics which you feel worthy of mentioning."

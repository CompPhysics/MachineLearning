# Teaching schedule with links to material


###  Week 2, January 11-15, 2021
This week is meant as a review and reading week. There are no lectures but we have, in addition to videos to watch, some simple recommendations on material to review. Note that we will start with these topics on Wednesday the 20th. If you don't have the possibility to look this material prior to our first lecture, a good fraction of this material is discussed during the first lecture.


- Introduction to the course and reminder  on vectors, space, time and motion, JRT chapters 1.2 and 1.3 and lecture notes (https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/week2/html/week2.html). Watch the video at https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/t/1_zzl90pfu
- Python programming reminder, elements from CMSE 201 and how they are used in this course. Installing software (anaconda). See slides at https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/pub/week2/html/week2.html). 
- Introduction to Git and GitHub/GitLab. Watch the video at https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/t/1_8mgx3cyf

For solving this exercise, AMS chapters 2 and 4 are very useful as review material. First homework set is available and due Monday January 25. See https://mhjensen.github.io/Physics321/doc/web/course.html (scroll down to homework 1). Parts of the homework will be discussed next week (Friday 22).

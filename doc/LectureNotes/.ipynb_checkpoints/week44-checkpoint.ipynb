    "\n",
    "After establishing the foundational understanding of applying\n",

    "primary function of convolution, as previously discussed, is to\n",
    "extract pertinent information from images while simultaneously\n",
    "decreasing the scale of our data. To initiate the image processing, we\n",
    "shall begin by partitioning the images into color channels (unless the\n",
    "image is grayscale), comprising three primary colors: red, green, and\n",
    "blue. We will subsequently utilize trainable kernels to construct a\n",
    "higher-dimensional encoding of each channel called feature\n",
    "maps. Successive layers will receive these feature maps as inputs,\n",
    "generating further encodings, albeit with reduced dimensions. The term\n",

    "kernel-shaped weights, which we will then train via backpropagation,\n",

    "To ensure seamless integration between our implementation of the\n",

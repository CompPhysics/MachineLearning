    "## Choose cost function and optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure how well our neural network is doing we need to introduce a cost function.  \n",

    "that gives the total error of our network across all samples the *cost* function.\n",
    "A typical choice for multiclass classification is the *cross-entropy* loss, also known as the negative log likelihood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In *multiclass* classification it is common to treat each integer label as a so called *one-hot* vector:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = 5 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{y} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = 1 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{y} = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) ,$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. a binary bit string of length $C$, where $C = 10$ is the number of classes in the MNIST dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y_{ic}$ denote the $c$-th component of the $i$-th one-hot vector.  \n",
    "We define the cost function $\\mathcal{C}$ as a sum over the cross-entropy loss for each point $\\hat{x}_i$ in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the one-hot representation only one of the terms in the loss function is non-zero, namely the\n",
    "probability of the correct category $c'$  \n",
    "(i.e. the category $c'$ such that $y_{ic'} = 1$). This means that the cross entropy loss only punishes you for how wrong\n",
    "you got the correct label. The probability of category $c$ is given by the softmax function. The vector $\\hat{\\theta}$ represents the parameters of our network, i.e. all the weights and biases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizing the cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is trained by finding the weights and biases that minimize the cost function. One of the most widely used classes of methods is *gradient descent* and its generalizations. The idea behind gradient descent\n",
    "is simply to adjust the weights in the direction where the gradient of the cost function is large and negative. This ensures we flow toward a *local* minimum of the cost function.  \n",
    "Each parameter $\\theta$ is iteratively adjusted according to the rule  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta_{i+1} = \\theta_i - \\eta \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta_i) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is known as the *learning rate*, which controls how big a step we take towards the minimum.  \n",
    "This update can be repeated for any number of iterations, or until we are satisfied with the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and effective improvement is a variant called *Batch Gradient Descent*.  \n",
    "Instead of calculating the gradient on the whole dataset, we calculate an approximation of the gradient\n",
    "on a subset of the data called a *minibatch*.  \n",
    "If there are $N$ data points and we have a minibatch size of $M$, the total number of batches\n",
    "is $N/M$.  \n",
    "We denote each minibatch $B_k$, with $k = 1, 2,...,N/M$. The gradient then becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla \\mathcal{C}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n",
    "\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i \\in B_k} \\nabla \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. instead of averaging the loss over the entire dataset, we average over a minibatch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This has two important benefits:  \n",
    "1. Introducing stochasticity decreases the chance that the algorithm becomes stuck in a local minima.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It significantly speeds up the calculation, since we do not have to use the entire dataset to calculate the gradient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The various optmization  methods, with codes and algorithms,  are discussed in our lectures on [Gradient descent approaches](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/Splines/html/Splines-bs.html).\n",

    "<!-- !split   -->\n",
    "## Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to add an extra term to the cost function, proportional\n",

    "size of the weights, so that they do not grow out of control.\n",
    "Constraining the size of the weights means that the weights cannot\n",
    "grow arbitrarily large to fit the training data, and in this way\n",
    "reduces *overfitting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure the size of the weights using the so called *L2-norm*, meaning our cost function becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\mathcal{C}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathcal{L}_i(\\theta) \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the model, we need to calculate the derivative of\n",
    "the cost function with respect to every bias and weight in the\n",
    "network.  In total our network has $(64 + 1)\\times 50=3250$ weights in\n",
    "the hidden layer and $(50 + 1)\\times 10=510$ weights to the output\n",
    "layer ($+1$ for the bias), and the gradient must be calculated for\n",
    "every parameter.  We use the *backpropagation* algorithm discussed\n",
    "above. This is a clever use of the chain rule that allows us to\n",
    "calculate the gradient efficently. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix  multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "To more efficently train our network these equations are implemented using matrix operations.  \n",
    "The error in the output layer is calculated simply as, with $\\hat{t}$ being our targets,  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta_L = \\hat{t} - \\hat{y} = (n_{inputs}, n_{categories}) .$$  \n",

    "should reflect the problems we are trying to solve.\n",

    "[Tensorflow uses](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graphs) so-called graphs to represent your computation\n",

    "to represent your model, and then create a Tensorflow *session* to run the graph.\n",

    "In this guide we will analyze the same data as we did in our NumPy and\n",

    "\n",
    "## Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural\n",
    "networks has important limitations. This is especially important when\n",
    "one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like\n",
    "all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or\n",
    "better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few\n",
    "hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random\n",
    "features). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need labeled data**. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems.\n",

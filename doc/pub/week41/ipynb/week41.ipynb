    "The choice of *hyperparameters* such as learning rate and regularization parameter is hugely influential for the performance of the network. Typically a *grid-search* is performed, wherein we test different hyperparameters separated by orders of magnitude. For example we could test the learning rates $\\eta = 10^{-6}, 10^{-5},...,10^{-1}$ with different regularization parameters $\\lambda = 10^{-6},...,10^{-0}$.  \n",

    "## Hidden layers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and it will work just fine.\n",
    "For the MNIST data set you ca easily get a high accuracy using just one hidden layer with a\n",
    "few hundred neurons.\n",

    "as large image classification or speech recognition, typically require networks with dozens of layers\n",
    "and they need a huge amount\n",
    "of training data. However, you will rarely have to train such networks from scratch: it is much more\n",

    "\n",

    "## Which activation function should I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Back propagation algorithm we derived above works by going from\n",
    "the output layer to the input layer, propagating the error gradient on\n",
    "the way. Once the algorithm has computed the gradient of the cost\n",
    "function with regards to each parameter in the network, it uses these\n",
    "gradients to update each parameter with a Gradient Descent (GD) step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately for us, the gradients often get smaller and smaller as the\n",
    "algorithm progresses down to the first hidden layers. As a result, the\n",
    "GD update leaves the lower layer connection weights\n",
    "virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good\n",
    "solution. This is known in the literature as \n",
    "**the vanishing gradients problem**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, the opposite can happen, namely the the gradients can grow bigger and\n",
    "bigger. The result is that many of the layers get large updates of the \n",
    "weights the\n",
    "algorithm diverges. This is the **exploding gradients problem**, which is\n",
    "mostly encountered in recurrent neural networks. More generally, deep\n",

    "## Is the Logistic activation function (Sigmoid)  our choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this unfortunate behavior has been empirically observed for\n",
    "quite a while (it was one of the reasons why deep neural networks were\n",
    "mostly abandoned for a long time), it is only around 2010 that\n",
    "significant progress was made in understanding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A paper titled [Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep\n",
    "Feedforward Neural Networks by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html) found that\n",
    "the problems with the popular logistic\n",
    "sigmoid activation function and the weight initialization technique\n",
    "that was most popular at the time, namely random initialization using\n",
    "a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of\n",
    "1. \n",
    "\n",
    "They showed that with this activation function and this\n",
    "initialization scheme, the variance of the outputs of each layer is\n",
    "much greater than the variance of its inputs. Going forward in the\n",
    "network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer until the\n",
    "activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made\n",
    "worse by the fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0\n",
    "(the hyperbolic tangent function has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly\n",
    "better than the logistic function in deep networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The derivative of the Logistic funtion\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the logistic activation function, when inputs become large\n",
    "(negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a\n",
    "derivative extremely close to 0. Thus when backpropagation kicks in,\n",
    "it has virtually no gradient to propagate back through the network,\n",
    "and what little gradient exists keeps getting diluted as\n",
    "backpropagation progresses down through the top layers, so there is\n",
    "really nothing left for the lower layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their paper, Glorot and Bengio propose a way to significantly\n",
    "alleviate this problem. We need the signal to flow properly in both\n",
    "directions: in the forward direction when making predictions, and in\n",
    "the reverse direction when backpropagating gradients. We don’t want\n",
    "the signal to die out, nor do we want it to explode and saturate. For\n",
    "the signal to flow properly, the authors argue that we need the\n",
    "variance of the outputs of each layer to be equal to the variance of\n",
    "its inputs, and we also need the gradients to have equal variance\n",
    "before and after flowing through a layer in the reverse direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the insights in the 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio was that\n",
    "the vanishing/exploding gradients problems were in part due to a poor\n",
    "choice of activation function. Until then most people had assumed that\n",
    "if Nature had chosen to use roughly sigmoid activation functions in\n",
    "biological neurons, they must be an excellent choice. But it turns out\n",
    "that other activation functions behave much better in deep neural\n",
    "networks, in particular the ReLU activation function, mostly because\n",
    "it does not saturate for positive values (and also because it is quite\n",
    "fast to compute).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The RELU function family\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReLU activation function suffers from a problem known as the dying\n",
    "ReLUs: during training, some neurons effectively die, meaning they\n",
    "stop outputting anything other than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you may find that half of your network’s neurons are\n",
    "dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. During training,\n",
    "if a neuron’s weights get updated such that the weighted sum of the\n",
    "neuron’s inputs is negative, it will start outputting 0. When this\n",
    "happen, the neuron is unlikely to come back to life since the gradient\n",
    "of the ReLU function is 0 when its input is negative.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Batch Normalization\n",
    "aims to address the vanishing/exploding gradients problems, and more generally the problem that the\n",

    "\n",
    "The technique consists of adding an operation in the model just before the activation function of each\n",
    "layer, simply zero-centering and normalizing the inputs, then scaling and shifting the result using two new\n",
    "parameters per layer (one for scaling, the other for shifting). In other words, this operation lets the model\n",
    "learn the optimal scale and mean of the inputs for each layer.\n",
    "In order to zero-center and normalize the inputs, the algorithm needs to estimate the inputs’ mean and\n",
    "standard deviation. It does so by evaluating the mean and standard deviation of the inputs over the current\n",
    "mini-batch, from this the name batch normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a fairly simple algorithm: at every training step, every neuron (including the input neurons but\n",
    "excluding the output neurons) has a probability $p$ of being temporarily dropped out, meaning it will be\n",
    "entirely ignored during this training step, but it may be active during the next step.\n",
    "\n",

    "test error in order to make tweaks to our model. It is crucial that we\n",
    "do not use any of the test data to train the algorithm. This is a\n",
    "cardinal sin in ML. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Estimate optimal error rate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimize underfitting (bias) on training data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure you are not overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the validation and test sets are drawn from the same distributions,\n",
    "then a good performance on the validation set should lead to similarly\n",
    "good performance on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes\n",
    "the training data and test data differ in subtle ways because, for\n",

    "because it is cheaper to collect data in one way versus another. In\n",

    "data. This can lead to the neural network overfitting these small\n",
    "differences between the test and training sets, and a poor performance\n",
    "on the test set despite having a good performance on the validation\n",

    "on these two validation sets quantifies the train-test mismatch. This\n",
    "can serve as another important diagnostic when using DNNs for\n",
    "supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of supervised learning with deep networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural\n",
    "networks has important limitations. This is especially important when\n",
    "one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like\n",
    "all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or\n",
    "better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few\n",
    "hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random\n",
    "features). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need labeled data**. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems.\n",

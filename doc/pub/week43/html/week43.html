<h2 id="convolutional-neural-networks-recognizing-images">Convolutional Neural Networks (recognizing images) </h2>

<p>
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed during the last
decade of the previous century, with a focus on character recognition
tasks. Nowadays, CNNs are a central element in the spectacular success
of deep learning methods. The success in for example image
classifications have made them a central tool for most machine
learning practitioners.

<p>
CNNs are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks.
They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and
biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and
optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still
expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image
pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a
loss function (for example Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer
and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural
Networks still apply (back propagation, gradient descent etc etc).

<p>
What is the difference? <b>CNN architectures make the explicit assumption that
the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties
into the architecture. These then make the forward function more
efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in
the network.</b>

<p>
Here we provide only a superficial overview, for the more interested, we recommend highly the course
<a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5400/index-eng.html" target="_blank">IN5400 &#8211; Machine Learning for Image Analysis</a>
and the slides of <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/" target="_blank">CS231</a>.

<p>
Another good read is the article here <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285.pdf" target="_blank"><tt>https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285.pdf</tt></a>.

<h2 id="neural-networks-vs-cnns">Neural Networks vs CNNs </h2>

<p>
Neural networks are defined as <b>affine transformations</b>, that is 
a vector is received as input and is multiplied with a matrix of so-called weights (our unknown paramters) to produce an
output (to which a bias vector is usually added before passing the result
through a nonlinear activation function). This is applicable to any type of input, be it an
image, a sound clip or an unordered collection of features: whatever their
dimensionality, their representation can always be flattened into a vector
before the transformation.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="why-cnns-for-images-sound-files-medical-images-from-ct-scans-etc">Why CNNS for images, sound files, medical images from CT scans etc? </h2>

<p>
However, when we consider images, sound clips and many other similar kinds of data, these data  have an intrinsic
structure. More formally, they share these important properties:</li>

<ul>
<li> They are stored as multi-dimensional arrays (think of the pixels of a figure) .</li>
<li> They feature one or more axes for which ordering matters (e.g., width and height axes for an image, time axis for a sound clip).</li>
<li> One axis, called the channel axis, is used to access different views of the data (e.g., the red, green and blue channels of a color image, or the left and right channels of a stereo audio track).</li>
</ul>

These properties are not exploited when an affine transformation is applied; in
fact, all the axes are treated in the same way and the topological information
is not taken into account. Still, taking advantage of the implicit structure of
the data may prove very handy in solving some tasks, like computer vision and
speech recognition, and in these cases it would be best to preserve it. This is
where discrete convolutions come into play.

<p>
A discrete convolution is a linear transformation that preserves this notion of
ordering. It is sparse (only a few input units contribute to a given output
unit) and reuses parameters (the same weights are applied to multiple locations
in the input).

<h2 id="regular-nns-don-t-scale-well-to-full-images">Regular NNs don&#8217;t scale well to full images </h2>

<p>
As an example, consider
an image of size \( 32\times 32\times 3 \) (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a
single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular
Neural Network would have \( 32\times 32\times 3 = 3072 \) weights. This amount still
seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not
scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable
size, say \( 200\times 200\times 3 \), would lead to neurons that have 
\( 200\times 200\times 3 = 120,000 \) weights.

<p>
We could have
several such neurons, and the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly,
this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters
would quickly lead to possible overfitting.

<h2 id="3d-volumes-of-neurons">3D volumes of neurons </h2>

<p>
Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the
input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more
sensible way.

<p>
In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the
layers of a CNN have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width,
height, depth. (Note that the word depth here refers to the third
dimension of an activation volume, not to the depth of a full Neural
Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.)

<p>
To understand it better, the above example of an image 
with an input volume of
activations has dimensions \( 32\times 32\times 3 \) (width, height,
depth respectively).

<p>
The neurons in a layer will
only be connected to a small region of the layer before it, instead of
all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. Moreover, the final
output layer could  for this specific image have dimensions \( 1\times 1 \times 10 \), 
because by the
end of the CNN architecture we will reduce the full image into a
single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth
dimension.

<p>
<center>  <!-- FIGURE -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 2:  A CNN arranges its neurons in three dimensions (width, height, depth), as visualized in one of the layers. Every layer of a CNN transforms the 3D input volume to a 3D output volume of neuron activations. In this example, the red input layer holds the image, so its width and height would be the dimensions of the image, and the depth would be 3 (Red, Green, Blue channels). </p></center>

<h2 id="layers-used-to-build-cnns">Layers used to build CNNs </h2>

<p>
A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN
transforms one volume of activations to another through a
differentiable function. We use three main types of layers to build
CNN architectures: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and
Fully-Connected Layer (exactly as seen in regular Neural Networks). We
will stack these layers to form a full CNN architecture.

<p>
A simple CNN for image classification could have the architecture:

<ul>
<li> <b>INPUT</b> (\( 32\times 32 \times 3 \)) will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.</li>
<li> <b>CONV</b> (convolutional )layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as \( [32\times 32\times 12] \) if we decided to use 12 filters.</li>
<li> <b>RELU</b> layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the \( max(0,x) \) thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged (\( [32\times 32\times 12] \)).</li>
<li> <b>POOL</b> (pooling) layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as \( [16\times 16\times 12] \).</li>
<li> <b>FC</b> (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size \( [1\times 1\times 10] \), where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of the MNIST images we considered above . As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transforming-images">Transforming images </h2>

<p>
CNNs transform the original image layer by layer from the original
pixel values to the final class scores.

<p>
Observe that some layers contain
parameters and other don&#8217;t. In particular, the CNN layers perform
transformations that are a function of not only the activations in the
input volume, but also of the parameters (the weights and biases of
the neurons). On the other hand, the RELU/POOL layers will implement a
fixed function. The parameters in the CONV/FC layers will be trained
with gradient descent so that the class scores that the CNN computes
are consistent with the labels in the training set for each image.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="cnns-in-brief">CNNs in brief </h2>

<p>
In summary:

<ul>
<li> A CNN architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores)</li>
<li> There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)</li>
<li> Each Layer accepts an input 3D volume and transforms it to an output 3D volume through a differentiable function</li>
<li> Each Layer may or may not have parameters (e.g. CONV/FC do, RELU/POOL don&#8217;t)</li>
<li> Each Layer may or may not have additional hyperparameters (e.g. CONV/FC/POOL do, RELU doesn&#8217;t)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cnns-in-more-detail-building-convolutional-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-and-keras">CNNs in more detail, building convolutional neural networks in Tensorflow and Keras </h2>

<p>
As discussed above, CNNs are neural networks built from the assumption that the inputs
to the network are 2D images. This is important because the number of features or pixels in images
grows very fast with the image size, and an enormous number of weights and biases are needed in order to build an accurate network.

<p>
As before, we still have our input, a hidden layer and an output. What's novel about convolutional networks
are the <b>convolutional</b> and <b>pooling</b> layers stacked in pairs between the input and the hidden layer.
In addition, the data is no longer represented as a 2D feature matrix, instead each input is a number of 2D
matrices, typically 1 for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue).

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="setting-it-up">Setting it up </h2>

<p>
It means that to represent the entire
dataset of images, we require a 4D matrix or <b>tensor</b>. This tensor has the dimensions:  
$$  
(n_{inputs},\, n_{pixels, width},\, n_{pixels, height},\, depth) .
$$

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="the-mnist-dataset-again">The MNIST dataset again </h2>

<p>
The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images with a pixel size of
\( 28\times 28 \), meaning we require \( 28 \times 28 = 724 \) weights to each
neuron in the first hidden layer.

<p>
If we were to analyze images of size \( 128\times 128 \) we would require
\( 128 \times 128 = 16384 \) weights to each neuron. Even worse if we were
dealing with color images, as most images are, we have an image matrix
of size \( 128\times 128 \) for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue),
meaning 3 times the number of weights \( = 49152 \) are required for every
single neuron in the first hidden layer.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="strong-correlations">Strong correlations </h2>

<p>
Images typically have strong local correlations, meaning that a small
part of the image varies little from its neighboring regions. If for
example we have an image of a blue car, we can roughly assume that a
small blue part of the image is surrounded by other blue regions.

<p>
Therefore, instead of connecting every single pixel to a neuron in the
first hidden layer, as we have previously done with deep neural
networks, we can instead connect each neuron to a small part of the
image (in all 3 RGB depth dimensions).  The size of each small area is
fixed, and known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_field" target="_blank">receptive</a>.

<p>
<!-- !split  -->

<h2 id="layers-of-a-cnn">Layers of a CNN </h2>
The layers of a convolutional neural network arrange neurons in 3D: width, height and depth.  
The input image is typically a square matrix of depth 3.

<p>
A <b>convolution</b> is performed on the image which outputs
a 3D volume of neurons. The weights to the input are arranged in a number of 2D matrices, known as <b>filters</b>.

<p>
Each filter slides along the input image, taking the dot product
between each small part of the image and the filter, in all depth
dimensions. This is then passed through a non-linear function,
typically the <b>Rectified Linear (ReLu)</b> function, which serves as the
activation of the neurons in the first convolutional layer. This is
further passed through a <b>pooling layer</b>, which reduces the size of the
convolutional layer, e.g. by taking the maximum or average across some
small regions, and this serves as input to the next convolutional
layer.

<p>
<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="systematic-reduction">Systematic reduction </h2>

<p>
By systematically reducing the size of the input volume, through
convolution and pooling, the network should create representations of
small parts of the input, and then from them assemble representations
of larger areas.  The final pooling layer is flattened to serve as
input to a hidden layer, such that each neuron in the final pooling
layer is connected to every single neuron in the hidden layer. This
then serves as input to the output layer, e.g. a softmax output for
classification.

<p>
The 6 lines of code below define the convolutional base using a common pattern: a stack of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers.

<p>
As input, a CNN takes tensors of shape (image_height, image_width, color_channels), ignoring the batch size. If you are new to these dimensions, color_channels refers to (R,G,B). In this example, you will configure our CNN to process inputs of shape (32, 32, 3), which is the format of CIFAR images. You can do this by passing the argument input_shape to our first layer.

<p>
You can see that the output of every Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layer is a 3D tensor of shape (height, width, channels). The width and height dimensions tend to shrink as you go deeper in the network. The number of output channels for each Conv2D layer is controlled by the first argument (e.g., 32 or 64). Typically, as the width and height shrink, you can afford (computationally) to add more output channels in each Conv2D layer.

<h2 id="add-dense-layers-on-top">Add Dense layers on top </h2>

<p>
To complete our model, you will feed the last output tensor from the
convolutional base (of shape (4, 4, 64)) into one or more Dense layers
to perform classification. Dense layers take vectors as input (which
are 1D), while the current output is a 3D tensor. First, you will
flatten (or unroll) the 3D output to 1D, then add one or more Dense
layers on top. CIFAR has 10 output classes, so you use a final Dense
layer with 10 outputs and a softmax activation.

<h2 id="recurrent-neural-networks-overarching-view">Recurrent neural networks: Overarching view </h2>

<p>
Till now our focus has been, including convolutional neural networks
as well, on feedforward neural networks. The output or the activations
flow only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.

<p>
A recurrent neural network (RNN) looks very much like a feedforward
neural network, except that it also has connections pointing
backward.

<p>
RNNs are used to analyze time series data such as stock prices, and
tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems, they can
anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally,
they can work on sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on
fixed-sized inputs like all the nets we have discussed so far. For
example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio samples as
input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing
systems such as automatic translation and speech-to-text.

<h2 id="formatting-the-data">Formatting the Data </h2>

<p>
The way the recurrent neural networks are trained in this program
differs from how machine learning algorithms are usually trained.
Typically a machine learning algorithm is trained by learning the
relationship between the x data and the y data.  In this program, the
recurrent neural network will be trained to recognize the relationship
in a sequence of y values.  This is type of data formatting is
typically used time series forcasting, but it can also be used in any
extrapolation (time series forecasting is just a specific type of
extrapolation along the time axis).  This method of data formatting
does not use the x data and assumes that the y data are evenly spaced.

<p>
For a standard machine learning algorithm, the training data has the
form of (x,y) so the machine learning algorithm learns to assiciate a
y value with a given x value.  This is useful when the test data has x
values within the same range as the training data.  However, for this
application, the x values of the test data are outside of the x values
of the training data and the traditional method of training a machine
learning algorithm does not work as well.  For this reason, the
recurrent neural network is trained on sequences of y values of the
form ((y1, y2), y3), so that the network is concerned with learning
the pattern of the y data and not the relation between the x and y
data.  As long as the pattern of y data outside of the training region
stays relatively stable compared to what was inside the training
region, this method of training can produce accurate extrapolations to
y values far removed from the training data set.

<p>
<!--  -->
<!-- The idea behind formatting the data in this way comes from [this resource](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) and [this one](https://fairyonice.github.io/Understand-Keras%27s-RNN-behind-the-scenes-with-a-sin-wave-example.html). -->
<!--  -->
<!-- The following method takes in a y data set and formats it so the "x data" are of the form (y1, y2) and the "y data" are of the form y3, with extra brackets added in to make the resulting arrays compatable with both Keras and Tensorflow. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Note: Using a sequence length of two is not required for time series forecasting so any lenght of sequence could be used (for example instead of ((y1, y2) y3) you could change the length of sequence to be 4 and the resulting data points would have the form ((y1, y2, y3, y4), y5)).  While the following method can be used to create a data set of any sequence length, the remainder of the code expects the length of sequence to be 2.  This is because the data sets are very small and the higher the lenght of the sequence the less resulting data points. -->

Changing the size of the recurrent neural network and its parameters
can drastically change the results you get from the model.  The below
code takes the simple recurrent neural network from above and adds a
second hidden layer, changes the number of neurons in the hidden
layer, and explicitly declares the activation function of the hidden
layers to be a sigmoid function.  The loss function and optimizer can
also be changed but are kept the same as the above network.  These
parameters can be tuned to provide the optimal result from the
network.  For some ideas on how to improve the performance of a

<h2 id="other-types-of-recurrent-neural-networks">Other Types of Recurrent Neural Networks </h2>

<p>
Besides a simple recurrent neural network layer, there are two other
commonly used types of recurrent neural network layers: Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  For a short
introduction to these layers see <a href="https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b" target="_blank"><tt>https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b</tt></a>
and <a href="https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b" target="_blank"><tt>https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b</tt></a>.

<p>
The first network created below is similar to the previous network,
but it replaces the SimpleRNN layers with LSTM layers.  The second
network below has two hidden layers made up of GRUs, which are
preceeded by two dense (feeddorward) neural network layers.  These
dense layers "preprocess" the data before it reaches the recurrent
layers.  This architecture has been shown to improve the performance
of recurrent neural networks (see the link above and also

    "The principal component analysis deals with the problem of fitting a\n",

    "the total dimension $D$ of the problem at hand (our data\n",
    "set). Mathematically it can be formulated as a statistical problem or\n",
    "a geometric problem.  In our discussion of the theorem for the\n",
    "classical PCA, we will stay with a statistical approach. \n",
    "Historically, the PCA was first formulated in a statistical setting in order to estimate the principal component of a multivariate random variable.\n",

    "* We may want to ask the following question: Are there fewer intrinsic variables (say $d << p$) that still approximately describe the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If so, these intrinsic variables may tell us something important and finding these intrinsic variables is what dimension reduction methods do. \n",

    "## LLE\n",
    "\n",
    "Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) is another very powerful nonlinear dimensionality reduction\n",
    "(NLDR) technique. It is a Manifold Learning technique that does not rely on projections like the previous\n",
    "algorithms. In a nutshell, LLE works by first measuring how each training instance linearly relates to its\n",
    "closest neighbors (c.n.), and then looking for a low-dimensional representation of the training set where\n",
    "these local relationships are best preserved (more details shortly). \n",

    "\n",
    "## Other techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other dimensionality reduction techniques, several of which are available in Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most popular:\n",
    "* **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)** reduces dimensionality while trying to preserve the distances between the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Isomap** creates a graph by connecting each instance to its nearest neighbors, then reduces dimensionality while trying to preserve the geodesic distances between the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding** (t-SNE) reduces dimensionality while trying to keep similar instances close and dissimilar instances apart. It is mostly used for visualization, in particular to visualize clusters of instances in high-dimensional space (e.g., to visualize the MNIST images in 2D).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is actually a classification algorithm, but during training it learns the most discriminative axes between the classes, and these axes can then be used to define a hyperplane onto which to project the data. The benefit is that the projection will keep classes as far apart as possible, so LDA is a good technique to reduce dimensionality before running another classification algorithm such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier discussed in the SVM lectures."

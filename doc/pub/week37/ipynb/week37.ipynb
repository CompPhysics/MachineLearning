    "\n",
    "Before we proceed, we need to rethink what we have been doing. In our\n",
    "eager to fit the data, we have omitted several important elements in\n",
    "our regression analysis. In what follows we will\n",
    "1. look at statistical properties, including a discussion of mean values, variance and the so-called bias-variance tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "2. introduce resampling techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping and jackknife and more\n",
    "\n",
    "and discuss how to select a given model (one of the difficult parts in machine learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling methods\n",
    "Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern\n",
    "statistics. They involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training\n",
    "set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to\n",
    "obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in\n",
    "order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can\n",
    "repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear\n",
    "regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which\n",
    "the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain\n",
    "information that would not be available from fitting the model only\n",
    "once using the original training sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two resampling methods are often used in Machine Learning analyses,\n",
    "1. The **bootstrap method**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. and **Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition there are several other methods such as the Jackknife and the Blocking methods. We will discuss in particular\n",
    "cross-validation and the bootstrap method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they\n",
    "involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using\n",
    "different subsets of the training data. However, due to recent\n",
    "advances in computing power, the computational requirements of\n",
    "resampling methods generally are not prohibitive. In this chapter, we\n",
    "discuss two of the most commonly used resampling methods,\n",
    "cross-validation and the bootstrap. Both methods are important tools\n",
    "in the practical application of many statistical learning\n",
    "procedures. For example, cross-validation can be used to estimate the\n",
    "test error associated with a given statistical learning method in\n",
    "order to evaluate its performance, or to select the appropriate level\n",
    "of flexibility. The process of evaluating a model’s performance is\n",
    "known as model assessment, whereas the process of selecting the proper\n",
    "level of flexibility for a model is known as model selection. The\n",
    "bootstrap is widely used.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why resampling methods ?\n",
    "**Statistical analysis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our simulations can be treated as *computer experiments*. This is particularly the case for Monte Carlo methods which are widely used in statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The results can be analysed with the same statistical tools as we would use when analysing experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As in all experiments, we are looking for expectation values and an estimate of how accurate they are, i.e., possible sources for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "## Resampling methods\n",
    "\n",
    "With all these analytical equations for both the OLS and Ridge\n",
    "regression, we will now outline how to assess a given model. This will\n",
    "lead to a discussion of the so-called bias-variance tradeoff (see\n",
    "below) and so-called resampling methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the quantities we have discussed as a way to measure errors is\n",
    "the mean-squared error (MSE), mainly used for fitting of continuous\n",
    "functions. Another choice is the absolute error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the discussions below we will focus on the MSE and in particular since we will split the data into test and training data,\n",
    "we discuss the\n",
    "1. prediction error or simply the **test error** $\\mathrm{Err_{Test}}$, where we have a fixed training set and the test error is the MSE arising from the data reserved for testing. We discuss also the \n",
    "\n",
    "2. training error $\\mathrm{Err_{Train}}$, which is the average loss over the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our model becomes more and more complex, more of the training data tends to  used. The training may thence adapt to more complicated structures in the data. This may lead to a decrease in the bias (see below for code example) and a slight increase of the variance for the test error.\n",
    "For a certain level of complexity the test error will reach minimum, before starting to increase again. The\n",

    "Since $\\widehat{\\beta} = \\widehat{\\beta}(\\boldsymbol{X})$ is a function of random variables,\n",
    "$\\widehat{\\beta}$ itself must be a random variable. Thus it has\n",
    "a pdf, call this function $p(\\boldsymbol{t})$. The aim of the bootstrap is to\n",
    "estimate $p(\\boldsymbol{t})$ by the relative frequency of\n",
    "$\\widehat{\\beta}$. You can think of this as using a histogram\n",

    "## Resampling methods: More Bootstrap background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case that $\\widehat{\\beta}$ has\n",

    "1. Draw with replacement $n$ numbers for the observed variables $\\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}^*$ containing the values which were drawn from $\\boldsymbol{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using the vector $\\boldsymbol{x}^*$ compute $\\widehat{\\beta}^*$ by evaluating $\\widehat \\beta$ under the observations $\\boldsymbol{x}^*$. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat this process $k$ times. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done, you can draw a histogram of the relative frequency\n",
    "of $\\widehat \\beta^*$. This is your estimate of the probability\n",
    "distribution $p(t)$. Using this probability distribution you can\n",
    "estimate any statistics thereof. In principle you never draw the\n",
    "histogram of the relative frequency of $\\widehat{\\beta}^*$. Instead\n",
    "you use the estimators corresponding to the statistic of interest. For\n",
    "example, if you are interested in estimating the variance of $\\widehat\n",

    "## Code example for the Bootstrap method\n",

    "complexity of a model and the amount of training data needed to train\n",
    "it.  Since data is often limited, in practice it is often useful to\n",

    "train and less sensitive to sampling noise arising from having a\n",
    "finite-sized training dataset (smaller variance). \n",

    "The above equations tell us that in\n",

    "statistical learning method that simultaneously achieves low variance\n",
    "and low bias. Note that variance is inherently a nonnegative quantity,\n",
    "and squared bias is also nonnegative. Hence, we see that the expected\n",
    "test MSE can never lie below $Var(\\epsilon)$, the irreducible error.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by the variance and bias of a statistical learning\n",
    "method? The variance refers to the amount by which our model would change if we\n",

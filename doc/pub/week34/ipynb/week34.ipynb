    "Our emphasis throughout this series of lectures  \n",
    "is on understanding the mathematical aspects of\n",
    "different algorithms used in the fields of data analysis and machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, where possible we will emphasize the\n",
    "importance of using available software. We start thus with a hands-on\n",
    "and top-down approach to machine learning. The aim is thus to start with\n",
    "relevant data or data we have produced \n",
    "and use these to introduce statistical data analysis\n",
    "concepts and machine learning algorithms before we delve into the\n",
    "algorithms themselves. The examples we will use in the beginning, start with simple\n",
    "polynomials with random noise added. We will use the Python\n",
    "software package [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and\n",
    "introduce various machine learning algorithms to make fits of\n",
    "the data and predictions. We move thereafter to more interesting\n",
    "cases such as data from say experiments (below we will look at experimental nuclear binding energies as an example).\n",
    "These are examples where we can easily set up the data and\n",
    "then use machine learning algorithms included in for example\n",
    "**Scikit-Learn**. \n",
    "\n",
    "These examples will serve us the purpose of getting\n",
    "started. Furthermore, they allow us to catch more than two birds with\n",
    "a stone. They will allow us to bring in some programming specific\n",
    "topics and tools as well as showing the power of various Python \n",
    "libraries for machine learning and statistical data analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will mainly focus on two\n",
    "specific Python packages for Machine Learning, Scikit-Learn and\n",
    "Tensorflow (see below for links etc).  Moreover, the examples we\n",
    "introduce will serve as inputs to many of our discussions later, as\n",
    "well as allowing you to set up models and produce your own data and\n",

    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics, data science and machine learning form important fields of\n",
    "research in modern science.  They describe how to learn and make\n",
    "predictions from data, as well as allowing us to extract important\n",
    "correlations about physical process and the underlying laws of motion\n",
    "in large data sets. The latter, big data sets, appear frequently in\n",
    "essentially all disciplines, from the traditional Science, Technology,\n",
    "Mathematics and Engineering fields to Life Science, Law, education\n",
    "research, the Humanities and the Social Sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has become more\n",
    "and more common to see research projects on big data in for example\n",
    "the Social Sciences where extracting patterns from complicated survey\n",
    "data is one of many research directions.  Having a solid grasp of data\n",
    "analysis and machine learning is thus becoming central to scientific\n",
    "computing in many fields, and competences and skills within the fields\n",
    "of machine learning and scientific computing are nowadays strongly\n",
    "requested by many potential employers. The latter cannot be\n",
    "overstated, familiarity with machine learning has almost become a\n",
    "prerequisite for many of the most exciting employment opportunities,\n",
    "whether they are in bioinformatics, life science, physics or finance,\n",
    "in the private or the public sector. This author has had several\n",
    "students or met students who have been hired recently based on their\n",
    "skills and competences in scientific computing and data science, often\n",
    "with marginal knowledge of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and is closely\n",
    "related to computational statistics.  It evolved from the study of\n",
    "pattern recognition in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and has\n",
    "made contributions to AI tasks like computer vision, natural language\n",
    "processing and speech recognition. Many of the methods we will study are also \n",
    "strongly rooted in basic mathematics and physics research. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, machine learning represents the science of giving computers\n",
    "the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is\n",
    "that there exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns\n",
    "in a broad class of data sets without having to write code\n",
    "specifically for each problem. The algorithm will build its own logic\n",
    "based on the data.  You should however always keep in mind that\n",
    "machines and algorithms are to a large extent developed by humans. The\n",
    "insights and knowledge we have about a specific system, play a central\n",

    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",

When an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain number of other nucleons in contact with it. This contribution is proportional to the volume.\n",

    " * There is a surface energy term $a_2A^{2/3}$. The assumption here is that a nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area.\n",
    "\n",
    " * There is a Coulomb energy term $a_3\\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}$. The electric repulsion between each pair of protons in a nucleus yields less binding. \n",
    "\n",
    " * There is an asymmetry term $a_4\\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}$. This term is associated with the Pauli exclusion principle and reflects the fact that the proton-neutron interaction is more attractive on the average than the neutron-neutron and proton-proton interactions.\n",

    "zero and the variance is one (every column in the design/feature\n",
    "matrix).  This scaling has the drawback that it does not ensure that\n",
    "we have a particular maximum or minimum in our data set. Another\n",
    "function included in **Scikit-Learn** is the **MinMaxScaler** which\n",
    "ensures that all features are exactly between $0$ and $1$. The\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Normalizer** scales each data\n",
    "point such that the feature vector has a euclidean length of one. In other words, it\n",
    "projects a data point on the circle (or sphere in the case of higher dimensions) with a\n",
    "radius of 1. This means every data point is scaled by a different number (by the\n",
    "inverse of it’s length).\n",
    "This normalization is often used when only the direction (or angle) of the data matters,\n",
    "not the length of the feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **RobustScaler** works similarly to the StandardScaler in that it\n",
    "ensures statistical properties for each feature that guarantee that\n",
    "they are on the same scale. However, the RobustScaler uses the median\n",
    "and quartiles, instead of mean and variance. This makes the\n",

    "(like measurement errors). These odd data points are also called\n",
    "outliers, and might often lead to trouble for other scaling\n",
    "techniques.\n",

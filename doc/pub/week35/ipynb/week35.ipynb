    "\n",
    "* It is the method of choice for fitting a continuous function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gives an excellent introduction to central Machine Learning features with **understandable pedagogical** links to other methods like **Neural Networks**, **Support Vector Machines** etc\n",

    "* Analytical expression for the fitting parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analytical expressions for statistical propertiers like mean values, variances, confidence intervals and more\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analytical relation with probabilistic interpretations \n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to introduce basic concepts like bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, resampling and regularization techniques and many other ML topics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to code! And links well with classification problems and logistic regression and neural networks\n",

    "* Allows for **easy** hands-on understanding of gradient descent methods\n",

    "* and many more features\n",

    "For more discussions of Ridge and Lasso regression, [Wessel van Wieringen's](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09169) article is highly recommended.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many Machine Learning problems involve thousands or even millions of features for each training\n",
    "instance. Not only does this make training extremely slow, it can also make it much harder to find a good\n",
    "solution, as we will see. This problem is often referred to as the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "Fortunately, in real-world problems, it is often possible to reduce the number of features considerably,\n",
    "turning an intractable problem into a tractable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will discuss some of the most popular dimensionality\n",
    "reduction techniques: the principal component analysis PCA, Kernel PCA, and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE).\n",

    "## Preprocessing our data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed however, we will discuss how to preprocess our\n",
    "data. Till now and in connection with our previous examples we have not met so many cases\n",
    "where we are too sensitive to the scaling of our data. Normally the\n",
    "data may need a rescaling and/or may be sensitive to extreme\n",
    "values. Scaling the data renders our inputs much more suitable for the\n",
    "algorithms we want to employ.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scikit-Learn** has several functions which allow us to rescale the data, normally resulting in much better results in terms of various accuracy scores.  The **StandardScaler** function in **Scikit-Learn** ensures that for each feature/predictor we study the mean value is zero and the variance is zero (every column in the design/feature matrix).\n",
    "This scaling has the drawback that it does not ensure that we have a particular maximum or minumum in our data set. Another function included in **Scikit-Learn** is the **MinMaxScaler** which ensures that all features are exactly between $0$ and $1$. The **Normalizer** function scales each column of the design matrix by its Euclidean norm.\n",

    "We show here how we can use a simple regression case (our nuclear binding energies discussed earlier).\n",

    "* **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)** reduces dimensionality while trying to preserve the distances between the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Isomap** creates a graph by connecting each instance to its nearest neighbors, then reduces dimensionality while trying to preserve the geodesic distances between the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding** (t-SNE) reduces dimensionality while trying to keep similar instances close and dissimilar instances apart. It is mostly used for visualization, in particular to visualize clusters of instances in high-dimensional space (e.g., to visualize the MNIST images in 2D).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is actually a classification algorithm, but during training it learns the most discriminative axes between the classes, and these axes can then be used to define a hyperplane onto which to project the data. The benefit is that the projection will keep classes as far apart as possible, so LDA is a good technique to reduce dimensionality before running another classification algorithm such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier discussed in the SVM lectures."

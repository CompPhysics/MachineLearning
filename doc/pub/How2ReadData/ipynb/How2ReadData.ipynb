    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our emphasis throughout this series of lectures  \n",
    "is on understanding the mathematical aspects of\n",
    "different algorithms used in the fields of data analysis and machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, where possible we will emphasize the\n",
    "importance of using available software. We start thus with a hands-on\n",
    "and top-down approach to machine learning. The aim is thus to start with\n",
    "relevant data or data we have produced \n",
    "and use these to introduce statistical data analysis\n",
    "concepts and machine learning algorithms before we delve into the\n",
    "algorithms themselves. The examples we will use in the beginning, start with simple\n",
    "polynomials with random noise added. We will use the Python\n",
    "software package [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and\n",
    "introduce various machine learning algorithms to make fits of\n",
    "the data and predictions. We move thereafter to more interesting\n",
    "cases such as data from say experiments (below we will look at experimental nuclear binding energies as an example).\n",
    "These are examples where we can easily set up the data and\n",
    "then use machine learning algorithms included in for example\n",
    "**Scikit-Learn**. \n",
    "\n",
    "These examples will serve us the purpose of getting\n",
    "started. Furthermore, they allow us to catch more than two birds with\n",
    "a stone. They will allow us to bring in some programming specific\n",
    "topics and tools as well as showing the power of various Python \n",
    "libraries for machine learning and statistical data analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will mainly focus on two\n",
    "specific Python packages for Machine Learning, Scikit-Learn and\n",
    "Tensorflow (see below for links etc).  Moreover, the examples we\n",
    "introduce will serve as inputs to many of our discussions later, as\n",
    "well as allowing you to set up models and produce your own data and\n",
    "get started with programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics, data science and machine learning form important fields of\n",
    "research in modern science.  They describe how to learn and make\n",
    "predictions from data, as well as allowing us to extract important\n",
    "correlations about physical process and the underlying laws of motion\n",
    "in large data sets. The latter, big data sets, appear frequently in\n",
    "essentially all disciplines, from the traditional Science, Technology,\n",
    "Mathematics and Engineering fields to Life Science, Law, education\n",
    "research, the Humanities and the Social Sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has become more\n",
    "and more common to see research projects on big data in for example\n",
    "the Social Sciences where extracting patterns from complicated survey\n",
    "data is one of many research directions.  Having a solid grasp of data\n",
    "analysis and machine learning is thus becoming central to scientific\n",
    "computing in many fields, and competences and skills within the fields\n",
    "of machine learning and scientific computing are nowadays strongly\n",
    "requested by many potential employers. The latter cannot be\n",
    "overstated, familiarity with machine learning has almost become a\n",
    "prerequisite for many of the most exciting employment opportunities,\n",
    "whether they are in bioinformatics, life science, physics or finance,\n",
    "in the private or the public sector. This author has had several\n",
    "students or met students who have been hired recently based on their\n",
    "skills and competences in scientific computing and data science, often\n",
    "with marginal knowledge of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and is closely\n",
    "related to computational statistics.  It evolved from the study of\n",
    "pattern recognition in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and has\n",
    "made contributions to AI tasks like computer vision, natural language\n",
    "processing and speech recognition. Many of the methods we will study are also \n",
    "strongly rooted in basic mathematics and physics research. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, machine learning represents the science of giving computers\n",
    "the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is\n",
    "that there exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns\n",
    "in a broad class of data sets without having to write code\n",
    "specifically for each problem. The algorithm will build its own logic\n",
    "based on the data.  You should however always keep in mind that\n",
    "machines and algorithms are to a large extent developed by humans. The\n",
    "insights and knowledge we have about a specific system, play a central\n",
    "role when we develop a specific machine learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young\n",
    "age. The increases we have seen during the last three decades in\n",
    "computational capabilities have been followed by developments of\n",
    "methods and techniques for analyzing and handling large date sets,\n",
    "relying heavily on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The\n",
    "field is rather new and developing rapidly. Popular software packages\n",
    "written in Python for machine learning like\n",
    "[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/),\n",
    "[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),\n",
    "[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/), all\n",
    "freely available at their respective GitHub sites, encompass\n",
    "communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number of\n",
    "code developers and contributors keeps increasing. Not all the\n",
    "algorithms and methods can be given a rigorous mathematical\n",
    "justification, opening up thereby large rooms for experimenting and\n",
    "trial and error and thereby exciting new developments.  However, a\n",
    "solid command of linear algebra, multivariate theory, probability\n",
    "theory, statistical data analysis, understanding errors and Monte\n",
    "Carlo methods are central elements in a proper understanding of many\n",
    "of algorithms and methods we will discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into\n",
    "two main categories.  In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a\n",
    "problem, and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other\n",
    "hand, *unsupervised learning* is a method for finding patterns and\n",
    "relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely\n",
    "*reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm of learning inspired by\n",
    "behavioral psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error,\n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the\n",
    "desired output of a system.  Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods we cover have three main topics in common, irrespective of\n",
    "whether we deal with supervised or unsupervised learning. The first\n",
    "ingredient is normally our data set (which can be subdivided into\n",
    "training and test data), the second item is a model which is normally a\n",
    "function of some parameters.  The model reflects our knowledge of the system (or lack thereof). As an example, if we know that our data show a behavior similar to what would be predicted by a polynomial, fitting our data to a polynomial of some degree would then determin our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last ingredient is a so-called **cost**\n",
    "function which allows us to present an estimate on how good our model\n",
    "is in reproducing the data it is supposed to train.  \n",
    "At the heart of basically all ML algorithms there are so-called minimization algorithms, often we end up with various variants of **gradient** methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software and needed installations\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make extensive use of Python as programming language and its\n",
    "myriad of available libraries.  You will find\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks invaluable in your work.  You can run **R**\n",
    "codes in the Jupyter/IPython notebooks, with the immediate benefit of\n",
    "visualizing your data. You can also use compiled languages like C++,\n",
    "Rust, Julia, Fortran etc if you prefer. The focus in these lectures will be\n",
    "on Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Python installed (we strongly recommend Python3) and you feel\n",
    "pretty familiar with installing different packages, we recommend that\n",
    "you install the following Python packages via **pip** as \n",
    "\n",
    "1. pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn mglearn sympy pandas pillow \n",
    "\n",
    "For Python3, replace **pip** with **pip3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For OSX users we recommend, after having installed Xcode, to\n",
    "install **brew**. Brew allows for a seamless installation of additional\n",
    "software via for example \n",
    "\n",
    "1. brew install python3\n",
    "\n",
    "For Linux users, with its variety of distributions like for example the widely popular Ubuntu distribution,\n",
    "you can use **pip** as well and simply install Python as \n",
    "\n",
    "1. sudo apt-get install python3  (or python for pyhton2.7)\n",

    "If you don't want to perform these operations separately and venture\n",
    "into the hassle of exploring how to set up dependencies and paths, we\n",

    " * There is a volume term $a_1A$ proportional with the number of nucleons (the energy is also an extensive quantity). When an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain number of other nucleons in contact with it. This contribution is proportional to the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    " * There is a surface energy term $a_2A^{2/3}$. The assumption here is that a nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area.\n",
    "\n",
    " * There is a Coulomb energy term $a_3\\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}$. The electric repulsion between each pair of protons in a nucleus yields less binding. \n",
    "\n",
    " * There is an asymmetry term $a_4\\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}$. This term is associated with the Pauli exclusion principle and reflects the fact that the proton-neutron interaction is more attractive on the average than the neutron-neutron and proton-proton interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also add a so-called pairing term, which is a correction term that\n",

    "## Practical tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Randomize the data when making mini-batches**. It is always important to randomly shuffle the data when forming mini-batches. Otherwise, the gradient descent method can fit spurious correlations resulting from the order in which data is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transform your inputs**. Learning becomes difficult when our landscape has a mixture of steep and flat directions. One simple trick for minimizing these situations is to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and normalizing the variance of input variables. Whenever possible, also decorrelate the inputs. To understand why this is helpful, consider the case of linear regression. It is easy to show that for the squared error cost function, the Hessian of the cost function is just the correlation matrix between the inputs. Thus, by standardizing the inputs, we are ensuring that the landscape looks homogeneous in all directions in parameter space. Since most deep networks can be viewed as linear transformations followed by a non-linearity at each layer, we expect this intuition to hold beyond the linear case.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Monitor the out-of-sample performance.** Always monitor the performance of your model on a validation set (a small portion of the training data that is held out of the training process to serve as a proxy for the test set. If the validation error starts increasing, then the model is beginning to overfit. Terminate the learning process. This *early stopping* significantly improves performance in many settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adaptive optimization methods don't always have good generalization.** Recent studies have shown that adaptive methods such as ADAM, RMSPorp, and AdaGrad tend to have poor generalization compared to SGD or SGD with momentum, particularly in the high-dimensional limit (i.e. the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points). Although it is not clear at this stage why these methods perform so well in training deep neural networks, simpler procedures like properly-tuned SGD may work as well or better in these applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geron's text, see chapter 11, has several interesting discussions."

    "The multilayer perceptron is a very popular, and easy to implement approach, to deep learning. It consists of\n",
    "1. A neural network with one or more layers of nodes between the input and the output nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The multilayer network structure, or architecture, or topology, consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and one output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The input nodes pass values to the first hidden layer, its nodes pass the information on to the second and so on till we reach the output layer.\n",
    "\n",

    "units and one layer of output units as  a two-layer network. A network with two layers of hidden units is called a three-layer network etc etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an MLP network there is no direct connection between the output nodes/neurons/units and  the input nodes/neurons/units.\n",
    "Hereafter we will call the various entities of a layer for nodes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The number of input nodes does not need to equal the number of output\n",

    "\n",
    "The hidden layers have their name from the fact that they are not\n",

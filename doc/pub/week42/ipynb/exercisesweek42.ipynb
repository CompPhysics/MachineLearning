    "This week, you will implement the entire feed-forward pass of a neural network! Next week you will compute the gradient of the network by implementing back-propagation manually, and by using autograd which does back-propagation for you (much easier!). Next week, you will also use the gradient to optimize the network with a gradient method! However, there is an optional exercise this week to get started on training the network and getting good results!\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that you do the exercises this week by editing and running this notebook file, as it includes some checks along the way that you have implemented the pieces of the feed-forward pass correctly, and running small parts of the code at a time will be important for understanding the methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have trouble running a notebook, you can run this notebook in google colab instead (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zKibVQf-iAYaAn2-GlKfgRjHtLnPlBX4#offline=true&sandboxMode=true), an updated link will be provided on the course discord (you can also send an email to k.h.fredly@fys.uio.no if you encounter any trouble), though we recommend that you set up VSCode and your python environment to run code like this locally.\n",

<h2 id="___sec0">Types of Machine Learning, a repetition </h2>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In <em>supervised learning</em> we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, <em>unsupervised learning</em>
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely <em>reinforcement learning</em>. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.

<p>
Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

<ul>
  <li> Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.</li>
  <li> Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.</li>
  <li> Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.</li>
  <li> Other unsupervised learning algortihms, here Boltzmann machines</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="___sec1">Why Boltzmann machines? </h2>

<p>
What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a lot of attention lately. 
One of the major reasons is that they can be stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture complicated statistics.

<p>
The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous data that are common to natural images.

<p>
Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated quantum mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models.

<h2 id="___sec3">A brief review on Markov Chains, Metropolis and Gibbs sampling </h2>

<ul>
<li> We want to study a physical system which evolves towards equilibrium, from given  initial conditions.</li>
<li> We start with a PDF \( w(x_0,t_0) \)  and we want to understand how the system evolves with time.</li>
<li> We want to reach a situation where after a given number of time steps we obtain a steady state. This means that the system reaches its most likely state (equilibrium situation)</li>
<li> Our PDF is normally a multidimensional object whose normalization constant is impossible to find.</li>
<li> Analytical calculations from \( w(x,t) \) are not possible.</li>
<li> To sample directly from from \( w(x,t) \) is not possible/difficult.</li>
<li> The transition probability \( W \) is also not  known.</li>
<li> How can we establish that we have reached a steady state?   Sounds impossible!</li>
</ul>

<b>Use Markov chain Monte Carlo</b>

<p>
<!-- !split  -->

<h2 id="___sec4">Brownian motion and Markov processes </h2>
A Markov process is a random walk with a selected probability for making a
move. The new move is independent of the previous history of the system.

<p>
The Markov process is used repeatedly in Monte Carlo simulations in order to generate
new random states.

<p>
The reason for choosing a Markov process is that when it is run for a
long enough time starting with a random state, we will eventually reach the most likely state of the system.

<p>
In thermodynamics, this means that after a certain number of Markov processes
we reach an equilibrium distribution.

<p>
This mimicks the way a real system reaches
its most likely state at a given temperature of the surroundings.

<p>
<!-- !split  -->

<h2 id="___sec5">Brownian motion and Markov processes, Ergodicity and Detailed balance </h2>

<p>
To reach this distribution, the Markov process needs to obey two important conditions, that of
<b>ergodicity</b> and <b>detailed balance</b>. These conditions impose then constraints on our algorithms
for accepting or rejecting new random states.

<p>
The Metropolis algorithm discussed here
abides to both these constraints.

<p>
The Metropolis algorithm is widely used in Monte Carlo
simulations and the understanding of it rests within
the interpretation of random walks and Markov processes.

<p>
<!-- !split  -->

<h2 id="___sec6">Brownian motion and Markov processes, jargon </h2>

<p>
In a random walk one defines a mathematical entity called a <b>walker</b>, 
whose  attributes
completely define the state of the system in question.

<p>
The state of the system  can refer to any physical quantities,
from the vibrational state of a molecule specified by a set of quantum numbers, 
to the brands of coffee in your favourite supermarket.

<p>
The walker moves in an appropriate state space by a combination of 
deterministic and random displacements from its previous
position.

<p>
This sequence of steps forms a <b>chain</b>.

<h2 id="___sec7">Brownian motion and Markov processes, sequence of ingredients </h2>

<ul>
<li> We want to study a physical system which evolves towards equilibrium, from given  initial conditions.</li>
<li> Markov chains are intimately linked with the physical process of diffusion.</li> 
<li> From a Markov chain we can then derive the conditions for detailed balance and ergodicity. These are the conditions needed for obtaining a steady state.</li>
<li> The widely used algorithm for doing this is the so-called Metropolis algorithm, in its refined form the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.</li>

The Black and Scholes equation is a partial differential equation, which describes the price
of the option over time. It is a diffusion equation with a random term.

<h2 id="___sec9">Markov processes </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
A Markov process allows in principle for a microscopic description of Brownian motion.
As with the random walk studied in the previous section, we consider a particle 
which moves along the  \( x \)-axis in the form of a series of jumps with step length 
\( \Delta x = l \). Time and space are discretized and the subsequent moves are
statistically independent, i.e., the new move depends only on the previous step
and not on the results from earlier trials. 
We start at a position \( x=jl=j\Delta x \) and move to 
a new position \( x =i\Delta x \) during a step \( \Delta t=\epsilon \), where 
\( i\ge  0 \) and \( j\ge 0 \) are integers. 
The original probability distribution function (PDF) of the particles is given by  
\( w_i(t=0) \) where \( i \) refers to a specific position on the grid in
</div>

The function \( w_i(t=0) \) is now the discretized version of \( w(x,t) \).
We can regard the discretized PDF as a vector.

<h2 id="___sec10">Markov processes </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
For the Markov process we have a transition probability from a position
\( x=jl \) to a position \( x=il \) given by
$$
\begin{equation*}
   W_{ij}(\epsilon)=W(il-jl,\epsilon)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{2} & |i-j| = 1\\
             0 & \mathrm{else} \end{array} \right. ,
\end{equation*}
$$

where \( W_{ij} \) is normally called 
the transition probability and we can represent it, see below,
as a matrix. 
<b>Here we have specialized to a case where the transition probability is known</b>.

<p>
Our new PDF \( w_i(t=\epsilon) \) is now related to the PDF at
\( t=0 \) through the relation

$$
\begin{equation*} 
   w_i(t=\epsilon) =\sum_{j} W(j\rightarrow i)w_j(t=0).
\end{equation*}
$$

<p>
This equation represents the discretized time-development of an original 
PDF with equal probability of jumping left or right.

<h2 id="___sec11">Markov processes, the probabilities </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">

<p>

<p>
Since both \( W \) and \( w \) represent probabilities, they have to be normalized, i.e., we require
that at each time step we have

$$
\begin{equation*}

The question then is how can we model anything under such a severe lack of knowledge? The Metropolis algorithm comes to our rescue here. Since \( W(j\rightarrow i) \) is unknown, we model it as the product of two probabilities, 
a probability for accepting the proposed move from the state \( j \) to the state \( j \), and a probability for making the transition to the state \( i \) being in the state \( j \). We label these probabilities \( A(j\rightarrow i) \) and \( T(j\rightarrow i) \), respectively.  Our total transition probability is then

$$
\begin{equation*}
W(j\rightarrow i)=T(j\rightarrow i)A(j\rightarrow i).
\end{equation*}
$$

The algorithm can then be expressed as

<ul>
  <li> We make a suggested move to the new state \( i \) with some transition or moving probability \( T_{j\rightarrow i} \).</li>
  <li> We accept this move to the new state with an acceptance probability \( A_{j \rightarrow i} \). The new state \( i \) is in turn used as our new starting point for the next move.  We reject this proposed moved with a \( 1-A_{j\rightarrow i} \) and the original state \( j \) is used again as a sample.</li>

We wish to derive the required properties of the probabilities \( T \) and \( A \) such that
\( w_i^{(t\rightarrow \infty)} \rightarrow w_i \), starting
from any distribution, will lead us to the correct distribution.

<p>
We can now derive the dynamical process towards 
equilibrium. To obtain this equation we note that after \( t \) time steps the probability for being in a state \( i \) is related 
to the probability of being in a state \( j \) and performing a transition to the new state together with the probability of actually being in the state \( i \) and making a move to any of the possible states \( j \) from the previous time step.

The last equation is very similar to the so-called Master equation, which relates the temporal dependence of 
a PDF \( w_i(t) \) to various transition rates. The equation can be derived from the so-called 
Chapman-Einstein-Enskog-Kolmogorov equation. The equation is given as 
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:masterequation}
\frac{d w_i(t)}{dt} = \sum_j\left[ W(j\rightarrow i)w_j-W(i\rightarrow j)w_i\right],

$$

which simply states that the rate at which the systems moves from a state \( j \)
to a final state \( i \) (the first term on the right-hand side of the last equation) is balanced by the rate at which the system undergoes transitions from the state \( i \) to a state \( j \) (the second term). If we have reached the so-called steady state, then the temporal development is zero. This  means that in equilibrium we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d w_i(t)}{dt} = 0.

\sum_j w_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}= \sum_j w_iW_{i\rightarrow j},

and using the property that \( \sum_j W_{i\rightarrow j}=1 \), we can rewrite our equation
as

$$
\begin{equation*}
w_i= \sum_j w_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i}= \sum_j w_j W_{j\rightarrow i},

However, the condition that the rates should equal each other is in general not sufficient
to guarantee that we, after many simulations, generate the correct distribution.
We may risk to end up with so-called cyclic solutions. To avoid this
we therefore introduce an additional condition, namely that of detailed balance

$$
\begin{equation*} W(j\rightarrow i)w_j= W(i\rightarrow j)w_i.  \end{equation*}
$$

These equations were derived by Lars Onsager when studying irreversible processes.
At equilibrium detailed balance gives thus

$$
\begin{equation*} \frac{W(j\rightarrow i)}{W(i\rightarrow j)}=\frac{w_i}{w_j}.  \end{equation*}
$$

Rewriting the last equation in terms of our transition probabilities \( T \) and 
acceptance probobalities \( A \) we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*} 
w_j(t)T_{j\rightarrow i}A_{j\rightarrow i}= w_i(t)T_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}.

However, the selection of states has to generate a final distribution which is the

The way we sample configurations should result, when equilibrium is established, in the

As stated above, we do in general not know the closed-form expression of the transition rate and we are free to model it as

To understand this better, assume that we have two energies, \( E_i \) and \( E_j \), with \( E_i < E_j \). This means that the largest acceptance value must be 
\( A(j\rightarrow i) \) since we move to a state with lower energy.  It follows from also from the fact that the probability \( w_i \) is larger than \( w_j \). 
The trick then is to fix this value to \( A(j\rightarrow i)=1 \). It means that 
the other acceptance probability has to be

\begin{equation*}
A(i\rightarrow j)= \exp{(-\beta(E_j-E_i))}.

$$

implying that if we move to a state with a lower energy, we always accept
this move with acceptance probability \( A(j\rightarrow i)=1 \). If the energy is higher, we need to check
this acceptance probability with the ratio between the probabilities  from our PDF.  From a practical point of view, 
the above ratio is compared with a random number.
If the ratio is smaller than a given random number we accept the move to a higher energy, else we stay in the same state.

  <li> Take a new value</li>

x^{(i+1)}= \left\{\begin{array}{cc} y_t & \mathrm{with\hspace{0.1cm}probability} = A(x^{(i)}\rightarrow y_t) \\                                           x^{(i)}    & \mathrm{with \hspace{0.1cm}probability} = 1-A(x^{(i)}\rightarrow y_t)\end{array}\right .

<li> A generative model can learn to represent and sample from a probability distribution. The core idea is to learn a parametric model of the probability distribution from which the training data was drawn. As an example

<ol type="a"></li>
 <li> A model for images could learn to draw new examples of cats and dogs, given a training dataset of images of cats and dogs.</li>
 <li> Generate a sample of an ordered or disordered Ising model phase, having been given samples of such phases.</li>
 <li> Model the trial function for Monte Carlo calculations</li>

<li> Both use gradient-descent based learning procedures for minimizing cost functions</li>
<li> Energy based models don't use backpropagation and automatic differentiation for computing gradients, instead turning to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.</li>
<li> DNNs often have several hidden layers. A restricted Boltzmann machine has only one hidden layer, however several RBMs can be stacked to make up Deep Belief Networks, of which they constitute the building blocks.</li>

In order to sample from the RBM probability distribution it is common to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings or Gibbs sampling.

<p>
Metropolis sampling starts by suggesting a new configuration \( \boldsymbol{x}^{k+1} \). In the brute force method this is done by some random change of the visible units. The new configuration is then accepted with the acceptance probability
$$
\begin{align}
	A(\boldsymbol{x}^k \rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}^{k+1}) = \text{min} (1, \frac{P(\boldsymbol{x}^{k+1})}{P(\boldsymbol{x}^k)}),

where we need the marginalized probability
$$
\begin{align}
	P(\boldsymbol{x})  &= \sum_\mathbf{h} P_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) 
\label{_auto8}\\
				&= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_\mathbf{h} e^{-E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})}.

$$

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2 id="___sec55">Sampling: Gibbs sampling </h2>

<p>
In this method we sample from the joint probability \( P_{rbm} (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) \) by way of a two step sampling process. We alternately update the visible and hidden units.
New samples are generated according to the conditional probabilities \( P(x_i|\mathbf{h}) \) and \( P(h_j|\mathbf{x}) \) respectively and accepted with the probability of \( 1 \). While the the visible nodes are dependent on the hidden nodes and vice versa, the nodes are independent of other nodes within the same layer. This is due to there being no intra layer interactions in the restricted Boltzmann machine.

<p>
The conditional probabilities are often referred to as the activitation functions in the neural networks context due to their role in determining the node outputs. For the binary-binary RBM they are
$$
\begin{align}
	P(h_j = 1 | \boldsymbol{x}) &= \frac{1}{1 + e^{-b_j - \sum_i x_i w_{ij}}} 
\label{_auto10}\\
	P(x_i = 1 | \boldsymbol{h}) &= \frac{1}{1 + e^{-a_j - \sum_j h_j w_{ij}}},
\label{_auto11}
\end{align}
$$

where we recognize the logistic sigmoid function \( \sigma (x) = 1/(1+exp(-x)) \).

<h2 id="___sec56">Gaussian RBM </h2>
For the Gaussian-Binary RBM the conditional probabilities are
$$
\begin{align}
	P(x_i|\mathbf{h}) &= \mathcal{N}(x_i; a_i+ \sum_j h_j w_{ij}, \sigma^2) 
\label{_auto12}\\
	P(h_j=1|\mathbf{x}) &=  \frac{1}{1+e^{-b_j-\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_i x_i w_{ij}}},

<h2 id="___sec57">Cost function </h2>

<p>
When working with a training dataset, the most common training approach is maximizing the log-likelihood of the training data. The log likelihood characterizes the log-probability of generating the observed data using our generative model. Using this method our cost function is chosen as the negative log-likelihood. The learning then consists of trying to find parameters that maximize the probability of the dataset, and is known as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
Denoting the parameters as \( \boldsymbol{\theta} = a_1,...,a_M,b_1,...,b_N,w_{11},...,w_{MN} \), the log-likelihood is given by
$$
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}(\{ \theta_i \}) &= \langle \text{log} P_\theta(\boldsymbol{x}) \rangle_{data} 
\label{_auto14}\\
	&= - \langle E(\boldsymbol{x}; \{ \theta_i\}) \rangle_{data} - \text{log} Z(\{ \theta_i\}),
\label{_auto15}
\end{align}
$$

where we used that the normalization constant does not depend on the data, \( \langle \text{log} Z(\{ \theta_i\}) \rangle = \text{log} Z(\{ \theta_i\}) \)
Our cost function is the negative log-likelihood, \( \mathcal{C}(\{ \theta_i \}) = - \mathcal{L}(\{ \theta_i \}) \)

at each \( k \)-th iteration. There are a range of variants of the algorithm which aim at making the learning rate \( \eta \) more adaptive so the method might be more efficient while remaining stable.

We now need the gradient of the cost function in order to minimize it. We find that
$$
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C}(\{ \theta_i\})}{\partial \theta_i}
	&= \langle \frac{\partial E(\boldsymbol{x}; \theta_i)}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle_{data}
	+ \frac{\partial \text{log} Z(\{ \theta_i\})}{\partial \theta_i} 
\label{_auto17}\\
	&= \langle O_i(\boldsymbol{x}) \rangle_{data} - \langle O_i(\boldsymbol{x}) \rangle_{model},
\label{_auto18}
\end{align}
$$

where in order to simplify notation we defined the "operator"
$$
\begin{align}
	O_i(\boldsymbol{x}) = \frac{\partial E(\boldsymbol{x}; \theta_i)}{\partial \theta_i}, 
\label{_auto19}
\end{align}
$$

and used the statistical mechanics relationship between expectation values and the log-partition function:
$$
\begin{align}
	\langle O_i(\boldsymbol{x}) \rangle_{model} = \text{Tr} P_\theta(\boldsymbol{x})O_i(\boldsymbol{x}) = - \frac{\partial \text{log} Z(\{ \theta_i\})}{\partial \theta_i}.
\label{_auto20}
\end{align}
$$

The data-dependent term in the gradient is known as the positive phase of the gradient, while the model-dependent term is known as the negative phase of the gradient. The aim of the training is to lower the energy of configurations that are near observed data points (increasing their probability), and raising the energy of configurations that are far from observed data points (decreasing their probability).

<p>
The gradient of the negative log-likelihood cost function of a Binary-Binary RBM is then
$$
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial w_{ij}} =& \langle x_i h_j \rangle_{data} - \langle x_i h_j \rangle_{model} 
\label{_auto21}\\
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial a_{ij}} =& \langle x_i \rangle_{data} - \langle x_i \rangle_{model} 
\label{_auto22}\\
	\frac{\partial \mathcal{C} (w_{ij}, a_i, b_j)}{\partial b_{ij}} =& \langle h_i \rangle_{data} - \langle h_i \rangle_{model}. 
\label{_auto23}\\
\label{_auto24}
\end{align}
$$

To get the expecation values with respect to the <em>data</em>, we set the visible units to each of the observed samples in the training data, then update the hidden units according to the conditional probability found before. We then average over all samples in the training data to calculate expectation values with respect to the data.

<h2 id="___sec60">Which sampling to use </h2>

<p>
To get the expectation values with respect to the <em>model</em>, we use Gibbs sampling. We can either initialize the \( \boldsymbol{x} \) randomly or with a training sample. While we ideally want a large number of Gibbs iterations \( n\rightarrow n \), one might decide to truncate it earlier for efficiency. Doing this while having intialized \( \boldsymbol{x} \) with a training data vector is referred to as contrastive divergence (CD), because one is then closer to approximating the gradient of this function than the negative log-likelihood. The contrastive divergence function is the difference between two Kullback-Leibler divergences (also called relative entropy), which measure how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution (in this case the estimated one from the ground truth one).

<h2 id="___sec61">Recent examples: RBMs for the quantum many body problem </h2>

<p>
The idea of applying RBMs to quantum many body problems was presented by G. Carleo and M. Troyer, working with ETH Zurich and Microsoft Research.

<p>
Some of their motivation included

<ul>
<li> "The wave function \( \Psi \) is a monolithic mathematical quantity that contains all the information on a quantum state, be it a single particle or a complex molecule. In principle, an exponential amount of information is needed to fully encode a generic many-body quantum state."</li>
<li> There are still interesting open problems, including fundamental questions ranging from the dynamical properties of high-dimensional systems to the exact ground-state properties of strongly interacting fermions.</li>
<li> The difficulty lies in finding a general strategy to reduce the exponential complexity of the full many-body wave function down to its most essential features. That is

<ol type="a"></li>
<li> \( \rightarrow \) Dimensional reduction</li>
<li> \( \rightarrow \) Feature extraction</li>
</ol>

<li> Among the most successful techniques to attack these challenges, artifical neural networks play a prominent role.</li>
<li> Want to understand whether an artifical neural network may adapt to describe a quantum system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec62">Choose the right RBM </h2>

<p>
Carleo and Troyer applied the RBM to the quantum mechanical spin lattice systems of the Ising model and Heisenberg model, with encouraging results. Our goal is to test the method on systems of moving particles. For the spin lattice systems it was natural to use a binary-binary RBM, with the nodes taking values of 1 and -1. For moving particles, on the other hand, we want the visible nodes to be continuous, representing position coordinates. Thus, we start by choosing a Gaussian-binary RBM, where the visible nodes are continuous and hidden nodes take on values of 0 or 1. If eventually we would like the hidden nodes to be continuous as well the rectified linear units seem like the most relevant choice.

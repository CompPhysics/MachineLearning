    "The main aim is to give you a short and pedestrian introduction to  how we can use Machine Learning methods\n",
    "to solve quantum mechanical many-body problems. And why this could be of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hope is that after this talk you have gotten the basic ideas to get you started. Peeping into <https://github.com/mhjensenseminars/MachineLearningTalk>, you'll find a Jupyter notebook, slides, codes etc that will allow you to reproduce the simulations discussed here, and perhaps run your own very first calculations.\n",

    "Furthermore, since we will also talk about Monte Carlo simulations, the exciting idea of Monte Carlo optimization and Machine Learning can be used to mesh strategies for reducing the curse of dimensionality.\n",

    "techniques for analyzing and handling large date sets, relying heavily\n",
    "on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The field is rather\n",

    "## What are the basic ingredients?\n",
    "Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:\n",
    "* The dataset $\\mathbf{x}$ (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)\n",
    "\n",
    "* A model which is a function of a set of parameters $\\mathbf{\\alpha}$ that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function $p(\\mathbf{x}\\vert \\mathbf{\\alpha})$ or just a simple model $f(\\mathbf{\\alpha})$\n",
    "\n",
    "* A so-called **cost** function $\\mathcal{C} (\\mathbf{x}, f(\\mathbf{\\alpha}))$ which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We seek to minimize the function $\\mathcal{C} (\\mathbf{x}, f(\\mathbf{\\alpha}))$ by finding the parameter values which minimize $\\mathcal{C}$. This leads to  various minimization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "Machine learning is the science of giving computers the ability to\n",
    "learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is that there\n",
    "exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns in a broad\n",
    "class of data sets without having to write code specifically for each\n",
    "problem. The algorithm will build its own logic based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and is closely\n",
    "related to computational statistics.  It evolved from the study of\n",
    "pattern recognition in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and has\n",
    "made contributions to AI tasks like computer vision, natural language\n",
    "processing and speech recognition. It has also, especially in later\n",
    "years, found applications in a wide variety of other areas, including\n",
    "bioinformatics, economy, physics, finance and marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice however that many of the basic ideas discussed do come from Physics!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",

    "Most mammalian predators rely on a variety of prey, which complicates mathematical modeling; however, a few predators have become highly specialized and seek almost exclusively a single prey species. An example of this simplified predator-prey interaction is seen in Canadian northern forests, where the populations of the lynx and the snowshoe hare are intertwined in a life and death struggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that this particular system has been so extensively studied is that the Hudson Bay company kept careful records of all furs from the early 1800s into the 1900s. The records for the furs collected by the Hudson Bay company showed distinct oscillations (approximately 12 year periods), suggesting that these species caused almost periodic fluctuations of each other's populations. The table here shows data from 1900 to 1920.\n",

    "Carleo and Troyer applied the RBM to the quantum mechanical spin lattice systems of the Ising model and Heisenberg model, with encouraging results. Our goal is to test the method on systems of moving particles. For the spin lattice systems it was natural to use a binary-binary RBM, with the nodes taking values of 1 and -1. For moving particles, on the other hand, we want the visible nodes to be continuous, representing position coordinates. Thus, we start by choosing a Gaussian-binary RBM, where the visible nodes are continuous and hidden nodes take on values of 0 or 1. If eventually we would like the hidden nodes to be continuous as well the rectified linear units seem like the most relevant choice.\n",

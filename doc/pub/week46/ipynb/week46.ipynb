    "layers that are connected to themselves.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks work very well when working with\n",

    "fully connected network, the order of input doesn't really matter.\n",

    "and output. Consider again the simplified breast cancer dataset. If you\n",
    "have trained a regular FCNN on the dataset with the two features, it\n",
    "makes no sense to suddenly add a third feature. The network would not\n",
    "know what to do with it, and would reject such inputs with three\n",
    "features (or any other number of features that isn't two, for that\n",

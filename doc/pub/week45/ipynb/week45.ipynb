    "\n",
    "After establishing the foundational understanding of applying\n",
    "convolution to spatial data, let us delve into the intricate workings\n",
    "of a convolutional layer in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The\n",
    "primary function of convolution, as previously discussed, is to\n",
    "extract pertinent information from images while simultaneously\n",
    "decreasing the scale of our data. To initiate the image processing, we\n",
    "shall begin by partitioning the images into color channels (unless the\n",
    "image is grayscale), comprising three primary colors: red, green, and\n",
    "blue. We will subsequently utilize trainable kernels to construct a\n",
    "higher-dimensional encoding of each channel called feature\n",
    "maps. Successive layers will receive these feature maps as inputs,\n",
    "generating further encodings, albeit with reduced dimensions. The term\n",
    "trainable kernels denotes the initialization of pre-defined\n",
    "kernel-shaped weights, which we will then train via backpropagation,\n",
    "similar to how weights are trained in a Feedforward Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure seamless integration between our implementation of the\n",
    "convolutional layer and popular machine learning frameworks like\n",
    "Tensorflow (Keras) and PyTorch, we have adopted a design pattern that\n",
    "mirrors the construction of models using these APIs. This involves\n",
    "implementing our convolutional layer as a Python class or object,\n",
    "which allows for a more modular and flexible approach to building\n",
    "neural networks. By structuring our code in this way, users can easily\n",
    "incorporate our implementation into their existing machine learning\n",
    "pipelines without having to make significant changes to their\n",

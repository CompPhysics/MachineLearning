    "\n",
    "1. Each instance attribute is evaluated using a statistical test to determine how well it alone classifies the training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The best attribute is selected and used as the test at the root node of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A descendant of the root node is then created for each possible value of this attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Training examples are sorted to the appropriate descendant node.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The entire process is then repeated using the training examples associated with each descendant node to select the best attribute to test at that point in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. This forms a greedy search for an acceptable decision tree, in which the algorithm never backtracks to reconsider earlier choices. \n",

    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unfortunately, trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as some of the other regression and classification approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "* If continuous features are used the tree may become quite large and hence less interpretable\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision trees are prone to overfit the training data and hence do not well generalize the data if no stopping criteria or improvements like pruning, boosting or bagging are implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small changes in the data may lead to a completely different tree. This issue can be addressed by using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting or random forests\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unbalanced datasets where some target feature values occur much more frequently than others may lead to biased trees since the frequently occurring feature values are preferred over the less frequently occurring ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number of features is relatively large (high dimensional) and the number of instances is relatively low, the tree might overfit the data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Features with many levels may be preferred over features with less levels since for them it is *more easy* to split the dataset such that the sub datasets only contain pure target feature values. This issue can be addressed by preferring for instance the information gain ratio as splitting criteria over information gain\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by aggregating many decision trees, using methods like\n",
    "bagging, random forests, and boosting, the predictive performance of\n",

    "Bagging typically results in improved accuracy\n",
    "over prediction using a single tree. Unfortunately, however, it can be\n",

    "advantages of decision trees is the attractive and easily interpreted\n",

    "most important to the procedure. Thus, bagging improves prediction\n",
    "accuracy at the expense of interpretability.  Although the collection\n",
    "of bagged trees is much more difficult to interpret than a single\n",
    "tree, one can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each\n",
    "predictor using the MSE (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini\n",
    "index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging\n",
    "regression trees, we can record the total amount that the MSE is\n",
    "decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all $B$ possible\n",
    "trees. A large value indicates an important predictor. Similarly, in\n",
    "the context of bagging classification trees, we can add up the total\n",
    "amount that the Gini index  is decreased by splits over a given\n",

    "## Why Voting?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind boosting, and voting as well can be phrased as follows:\n",
    "**Can a group of people somehow arrive at highly\n",
    "reasoned decisions, despite the weak judgement of the individual\n",
    "members?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to create a good classifier by combining several weak classifiers.\n",
    "**A weak classifier is a classifier which is able to produce results that are only slightly better than guessing at random.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic approach is to apply repeatedly (in boosting this is done in an iterative way) a weak classifier to modifications of the data.\n",
    "In voting we simply apply the law of large numbers while in boosting we give more weight to misclassified data in\n",
    "each iteration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees play an important role as our weak classifier. They serve as the basic method."

    "## Tossing coins\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest case is a so-called voting ensemble. To illustrate this,\n",
    "think of yourself tossing coins with a biased outcome of 51 per cent\n",
    "for heads and 49% for tails. With only few tosses,\n",
    "you may not clearly see this distribution for heads and tails. However, after some\n",
    "thousands of tosses, there will be a clear majority of heads.  With 2000 tosses\n",
    "you should see approximately 1020 heads and 980 tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then state that the outcome is a clear majority of heads. If\n",
    "you do this ten thousand times, it is easy to see that there is a 97%\n",
    "likelihood of a majority of heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example would be to collect all polls before an\n",
    "election. Different polls may show different likelihoods for a\n",
    "candidate winning with say a majority  of the popular vote. The majority vote\n",
    "would then consist in many polls indicating that this candidate will\n",
    "actually win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example here shows how we can implement the coin tossing case,\n",
    "clealry demostrating that after some tosses we see the [law of large](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)\n",
    "numbers kicking in."

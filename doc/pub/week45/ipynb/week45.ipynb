    "Decision trees are supervised learning algorithms used for both,\n",
    "classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of decision trees\n",

    "for the resulting underlying datasets are as pure as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptive features which reproduce best the target/output features are normally  said\n",
    "to be the most informative ones. The process of finding the **most\n",
    "informative** feature is done until we accomplish a stopping criteria\n",

    "for heads and 49% for tails. With only few tosses,\n",
    "you may not clearly see this distribution for heads and tails. However, after some\n",

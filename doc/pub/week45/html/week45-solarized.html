<h2 id="convolutional-neural-networks-recognizing-images-reminder-from-last-week">Convolutional Neural Networks (recognizing images), reminder from last week </h2>

<p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed during the last
decade of the previous century, with a focus on character recognition
tasks. Nowadays, CNNs are a central element in the spectacular success
of deep learning methods. The success in for example image
classifications have made them a central tool for most machine
learning practitioners.
</p>

<p>CNNs are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks.
They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and
biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and
optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still
expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image
pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a
loss function (for example Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer
and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural
Networks still apply (back propagation, gradient descent etc etc).
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="what-is-the-difference">What is the Difference </h2>

<p><b>CNN architectures make the explicit assumption that
the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties
into the architecture. These then make the forward function more
efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in
the network.</b>
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="neural-networks-vs-cnns">Neural Networks vs CNNs </h2>

<p>Neural networks are defined as <b>affine transformations</b>, that is 
a vector is received as input and is multiplied with a matrix of so-called weights (our unknown paramters) to produce an
output (to which a bias vector is usually added before passing the result
through a nonlinear activation function). This is applicable to any type of input, be it an
image, a sound clip or an unordered collection of features: whatever their
dimensionality, their representation can always be flattened into a vector
before the transformation.
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="why-cnns-for-images-sound-files-medical-images-from-ct-scans-etc">Why CNNS for images, sound files, medical images from CT scans etc? </h2>

<p>However, when we consider images, sound clips and many other similar kinds of data, these data  have an intrinsic
structure. More formally, they share these important properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li> They are stored as multi-dimensional arrays (think of the pixels of a figure) .</li>
<li> They feature one or more axes for which ordering matters (e.g., width and height axes for an image, time axis for a sound clip).</li>
<li> One axis, called the channel axis, is used to access different views of the data (e.g., the red, green and blue channels of a color image, or the left and right channels of a stereo audio track).</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties are not exploited when an affine transformation is applied; in
fact, all the axes are treated in the same way and the topological information
is not taken into account. Still, taking advantage of the implicit structure of
the data may prove very handy in solving some tasks, like computer vision and
speech recognition, and in these cases it would be best to preserve it. This is
where discrete convolutions come into play.
</p>

<p>A discrete convolution is a linear transformation that preserves this notion of
ordering. It is sparse (only a few input units contribute to a given output
unit) and reuses parameters (the same weights are applied to multiple locations
in the input).
</p>

<h2 id="regular-nns-don-t-scale-well-to-full-images">Regular NNs don&#8217;t scale well to full images </h2>

<p>As an example, consider
an image of size \( 32\times 32\times 3 \) (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a
single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular
Neural Network would have \( 32\times 32\times 3 = 3072 \) weights. This amount still
seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not
scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable
size, say \( 200\times 200\times 3 \), would lead to neurons that have 
\( 200\times 200\times 3 = 120,000 \) weights. 
</p>

<p>We could have
several such neurons, and the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly,
this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters
would quickly lead to possible overfitting.
</p>

<h2 id="3d-volumes-of-neurons">3D volumes of neurons </h2>

<p>Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the
input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more
sensible way. 
</p>

<p>In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the
layers of a CNN have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width,
height, depth. (Note that the word depth here refers to the third
dimension of an activation volume, not to the depth of a full Neural
Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.)
</p>

<p>To understand it better, the above example of an image 
with an input volume of
activations has dimensions \( 32\times 32\times 3 \) (width, height,
depth respectively). 
</p>

<p>The neurons in a layer will
only be connected to a small region of the layer before it, instead of
all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. Moreover, the final
output layer could  for this specific image have dimensions \( 1\times 1 \times 10 \), 
because by the
end of the CNN architecture we will reduce the full image into a
single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth
dimension. 
</p>

<center>  <!-- FIGURE -->
<hr class="figure">
<center>
<p class="caption">Figure 2:  A CNN arranges its neurons in three dimensions (width, height, depth), as visualized in one of the layers. Every layer of a CNN transforms the 3D input volume to a 3D output volume of neuron activations. In this example, the red input layer holds the image, so its width and height would be the dimensions of the image, and the depth would be 3 (Red, Green, Blue channels). </p>

<h2 id="more-on-dimensionalities">More on Dimensionalities </h2>

<p>In fields like signal processing (and imaging as well), one designs
so-called filters. These filters are defined by the convolutions and
are often hand-crafted. One may specify filters for smoothing, edge
detection, frequency reshaping, and similar operations. However with
neural networks the idea is to automatically learn the filters and use
many of them in conjunction with non-linear operations (activation
functions).
</p>

<p>As an example consider a neural network operating on sound sequence
data.  Assume that we an input vector \( \boldsymbol{x} \) of length \( d=10^6 \).  We
construct then a neural network with onle hidden layer only with
\( 10^4 \) nodes. This means that we will have a weight matrix with
\( 10^4\times 10^6=10^{10} \) weights to be determined, together with \( 10^4 \) biases.
</p>

<p>Assume furthermore that we have an output layer which is meant to train whether the sound sequence represents a human voice (true) or something else (false).
It means that we have only one output node. But since this output node connects to \( 10^4 \) nodes in the hidden layer, there are in total \( 10^4 \) weights to be determined for the output layer, plus one bias. In total we have
</p>

$$
\mathrm{NumberParameters}=10^{10}+10^4+10^4+1 \approx 10^{10},

<h2 id="further-remarks">Further remarks </h2>

<p>The main principles that justify convolutions is locality of
information and repetion of patterns within the signal. Sound samples
of the input in adjacent spots are much more likely to affect each
other than those that are very far away. Similarly, sounds are
repeated in multiple times in the signal. While slightly simplistic,
reasoning about such a sound example demonstrates this. The same
principles then apply to images and other similar data.

<h2 id="layers-used-to-build-cnns">Layers used to build CNNs </h2>

<p>A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN
transforms one volume of activations to another through a
differentiable function. We use three main types of layers to build
CNN architectures: Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and
Fully-Connected Layer (exactly as seen in regular Neural Networks). We
will stack these layers to form a full CNN architecture.
</p>

<p>A simple CNN for image classification could have the architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>INPUT</b> (\( 32\times 32 \times 3 \)) will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case an image of width 32, height 32, and with three color channels R,G,B.</li>
<li> <b>CONV</b> (convolutional )layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as \( [32\times 32\times 12] \) if we decided to use 12 filters.</li>
<li> <b>RELU</b> layer will apply an elementwise activation function, such as the \( max(0,x) \) thresholding at zero. This leaves the size of the volume unchanged (\( [32\times 32\times 12] \)).</li>
<li> <b>POOL</b> (pooling) layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height), resulting in volume such as \( [16\times 16\times 12] \).</li>
<li> <b>FC</b> (i.e. fully-connected) layer will compute the class scores, resulting in volume of size \( [1\times 1\times 10] \), where each of the 10 numbers correspond to a class score, such as among the 10 categories of the MNIST images we considered above . As with ordinary Neural Networks and as the name implies, each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the numbers in the previous volume.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transforming-images">Transforming images </h2>

<p>CNNs transform the original image layer by layer from the original
pixel values to the final class scores. 
</p>

<p>Observe that some layers contain
parameters and other don&#8217;t. In particular, the CNN layers perform
transformations that are a function of not only the activations in the
input volume, but also of the parameters (the weights and biases of
the neurons). On the other hand, the RELU/POOL layers will implement a
fixed function. The parameters in the CONV/FC layers will be trained
with gradient descent so that the class scores that the CNN computes
are consistent with the labels in the training set for each image.

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul>
<li> A CNN architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume (e.g. holding the class scores)</li>
<li> There are a few distinct types of Layers (e.g. CONV/FC/RELU/POOL are by far the most popular)</li>

<h2 id="key-idea">Key Idea </h2>

<p>A dense neural network is representd by an affine operation (like matrix-matrix multiplication) where all parameters are included.</p>

<p>The key idea in CNNs for say imaging is that in images neighbor pixels tend to be related! So we connect
only neighboring neurons in the input instead of connecting all with the first hidden layer.
</p>

<p>We say we perform a filtering (convolution is the mathematical operation). </p>

<h2 id="mathematics-of-cnns">Mathematics of CNNs </h2>

<p>The mathematics of CNNs is based on the mathematical operation of
<b>convolution</b>.  In mathematics (in particular in functional analysis),
convolution is represented by mathematical operations (integration,
summation etc) on two functions in order to produce a third function
that expresses how the shape of one gets modified by the other.
Convolution has a plethora of applications in a variety of
disciplines, spanning from statistics to signal processing, computer
vision, solutions of differential equations,linear algebra,
engineering, and yes, machine learning.
</p>

<p>Mathematically, convolution is defined as follows (one-dimensional example):
Let us define a continuous function \( y(t) \) given by
</p>
$$
y(t) = \int x(a) w(t-a) da,
$$

<p>where \( x(a) \) represents a so-called input and \( w(t-a) \) is normally called the weight function or kernel.</p>

<p>The above integral is written in  a more compact form as</p>
$$
y(t) = \left(x * w\right)(t).
$$

<p>The discretized version reads</p>
$$
y(t) = \sum_{a=-\infty}^{a=\infty}x(a)w(t-a).
$$

<p>Computing the inverse of the above convolution operations is known as deconvolution and the process is commutative.</p>

<p>How can we use this? And what does it mean? Let us study some familiar examples first.</p>

<h2 id="convolution-examples-polynomial-multiplication">Convolution Examples: Polynomial multiplication </h2>

<p>Our first example is that of a multiplication between two polynomials,
which we will rewrite in terms of the mathematics of convolution. In
the final stage, since the problem here is a discrete one, we will
recast the final expression in terms of a matrix-vector
multiplication, where the matrix is a so-called <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-93-86279-04-0" target="_blank">Toeplitz matrix

</p>

<p>Let us look a the following polynomials to second and third order, respectively:</p>
$$
p(t) = \alpha_0+\alpha_1 t+\alpha_2 t^2,
$$

<p>and</p>
$$
s(t) = \beta_0+\beta_1 t+\beta_2 t^2+\beta_3 t^3.
$$

<p>The polynomial multiplication gives us a new polynomial of degree \( 5 \)</p>
$$
z(t) = \delta_0+\delta_1 t+\delta_2 t^2+\delta_3 t^3+\delta_4 t^4+\delta_5 t^5.

<h2 id="efficient-polynomial-multiplication">Efficient Polynomial Multiplication </h2>

<p>Computing polynomial products can be implemented efficiently if we rewrite the more brute force multiplications using convolution.
We note first that the new coefficients are given as
</p>

$$
\begin{split}
\delta_0=&\alpha_0\beta_0\\
\delta_1=&\alpha_1\beta_0+\alpha_0\beta_1\\
\delta_2=&\alpha_0\beta_2+\alpha_1\beta_1+\alpha_2\beta_0\\
\delta_3=&\alpha_1\beta_2+\alpha_2\beta_1+\alpha_0\beta_3\\
\delta_4=&\alpha_2\beta_2+\alpha_1\beta_3\\
\delta_5=&\alpha_2\beta_3.\\
\end{split}
$$

<p>We note that \( \alpha_i=0 \) except for \( i\in \left\{0,1,2\right\} \) and \( \beta_i=0 \) except for \( i\in\left\{0,1,2,3\right\} \).</p>

<p>We can then rewrite the coefficients \( \delta_j \) using a discrete convolution as</p>
$$
\delta_j = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{i=\infty}\alpha_i\beta_{j-i}=(\alpha * \beta)_j,
$$

<p>or as a double sum with restriction \( l=i+j \)</p>

<p>where \( m=3 \) in our case, the maximum length of
the vector \( \alpha \). Note that the vector \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \) has length \( n=4 \). Below we will find an even more efficient representation.

$$
\boldsymbol{\delta}=\begin{bmatrix}\alpha_0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

<h2 id="commutative-process">Commutative process </h2>

<p>The process is commutative and we can easily see that we can rewrite the multiplication in terms of  a matrix holding \( \beta \) and a vector holding \( \alpha \).
In this case we have
</p>
$$
\boldsymbol{\delta}=\begin{bmatrix}\beta_0 & 0 & 0  \\
                            \beta_1 & \beta_0 & 0  \\

			    0 & 0 & \beta_3
			    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_0 \\ \alpha_1 \\ \alpha_2\end{bmatrix}.
$$

<p>Note that the use of these matrices is for mathematical purposes only
and not implementation purposes.  When implementing the above equation
we do not encode (and allocate memory) the matrices explicitely.  We
rather code the convolutions in the minimal memory footprint that they
require.

Toeplitz matrix is a matrix in which each descending diagonal from
left to right is constant. For instance the last matrix, which we
rewrite as
</p>
$$
\boldsymbol{A}=\begin{bmatrix}a_0 & 0 & 0  \\

<p>with elements \( a_{ii}=a_{i+1,j+1}=a_{i-j} \) is an example of a Toeplitz
matrix. Such a matrix does not need to be a square matrix.  Toeplitz
matrices are also closely connected with Fourier series, because the multiplication operator by a trigonometric
polynomial, compressed to a finite-dimensional space, can be
represented by such a matrix. The example above shows that we can
represent linear convolution as multiplication of a Toeplitz matrix by
a vector.

<h2 id="generalizing-the-above-one-dimensional-case">Generalizing the above one-dimensional case </h2>

<p>In order to align the above simple case with the more general
convolution cases, we rename \( \boldsymbol{\alpha} \), whose length is \( m=3 \),
with \( \boldsymbol{w} \).  We will interpret \( \boldsymbol{w} \) as a weight/filter function
with which we want to perform the convolution with an input variable
\( \boldsymbol{x} \) of length \( n \).  We will assume always that the filter
\( \boldsymbol{w} \) has dimensionality \( m \le n \).
</p>

<p>We replace thus \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \) with \( \boldsymbol{x} \) and \( \boldsymbol{\delta} \) with \( \boldsymbol{y} \) and have</p>
$$
y(i)= \left(x*w\right)(i)= \sum_{k=0}^{k=m-1}w(k)x(i-k),
$$

<p>where \( m=3 \) in our case, the maximum length of the vector \( \boldsymbol{w} \).
Here the symbol \( * \) represents the mathematical operation of convolution.

<h2 id="memory-considerations">Memory considerations </h2>

<p>This expression leaves us however with some terms with negative

</p>

<p>The index \( j \) for \( \boldsymbol{x} \) runs from \( j=0 \) to \( j=3 \) since \( \boldsymbol{x} \) is meant to
represent a third-order polynomial.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, the index \( i \) runs from \( i=0 \) to \( i=5 \) since \( \boldsymbol{y} \)
contains the coefficients of a fifth-order polynomial.  When \( i=5 \) we
may also have values of \( x(4) \) and \( x(5) \) which are not defined.

<h2 id="padding">Padding </h2>

<p>The solution to this is what is called <b>padding</b>!  We simply define a
new vector \( x \) with two added elements set to zero before \( x(0) \) and
two new elements after \( x(3) \) set to zero. That is, we augment the
length of \( \boldsymbol{x} \) from \( n=4 \) to \( n+2P=8 \), where \( P=2 \) is the padding
constant (a new hyperparameter), see discussions below as well.
</p>

<h2 id="new-vector">New vector </h2>

<p>We have a new vector defined as \( x(0)=0 \), \( x(1)=0 \),
\( x(2)=\beta_0 \), \( x(3)=\beta_1 \), \( x(4)=\beta_2 \), \( x(5)=\beta_3 \),
\( x(6)=0 \), and \( x(7)=0 \).
</p>

<p>We have added four new elements, which
are all zero. The benefit is that we can rewrite the equation for
\( \boldsymbol{y} \), with \( i=0,1,\dots,5 \),
</p>
$$
y(i) = \sum_{k=0}^{k=m-1}w(k)x(i+(m-1)-k).
$$

<p>As an example, we have</p>
$$
y(4)=x(6)w(0)+x(5)w(1)+x(4)w(2)=0\times \alpha_0+\beta_3\alpha_1+\beta_2\alpha_2,
$$

<p>as before except that we have an additional term \( x(6)w(0) \), which is zero.</p>

<p>Similarly, for the fifth-order term we have</p>
$$
y(5)=x(7)w(0)+x(6)w(1)+x(5)w(2)=0\times \alpha_0+0\times\alpha_1+\beta_3\alpha_2.
$$

<p>The zeroth-order term is</p>
$$
y(0)=x(2)w(0)+x(1)w(1)+x(0)w(2)=\beta_0 \alpha_0+0\times\alpha_1+0\times\alpha_2=\alpha_0\beta_0.

y(0)=x(2)w(0)+x(1)w(1)+x(0)w(2)=x(2)\tilde{w}(2)+x(1)\tilde{w}(1)+x(0)\tilde{w}(0),
$$

<p>with \( \tilde{w}(0)=w(2) \), \( \tilde{w}(1)=w(1) \), and \( \tilde{w}(2)=w(0) \), we can then rewrite the above sum as a dot product of
\( x(i:i+(m-1))\tilde{w} \) for element \( y(i) \), where \( x(i:i+(m-1)) \) is simply a patch of \( \boldsymbol{x} \) of size \( m-1 \).
</p>

<p>The padding \( P \) we have introduced for the convolution stage is just
another hyperparameter which is introduced as part of the

<h2 id="two-dimensional-objects">Two-dimensional objects </h2>

<p>We are now ready to start studying the discrete convolutions relevant for convolutional neural networks.
We often use convolutions over more than one dimension at a time. If
we have a two-dimensional image \( X \) as input, we can have a <b>filter</b>
defined by a two-dimensional <b>kernel/weight/filter</b> \( W \). This leads to an output \( Y \)
</p>

$$
Y(i,j)=(X * W)(i,j) = \sum_m\sum_n X(m,n)W(i-m,j-n).
$$

<p>Convolution is a commutative process, which means we can rewrite this equation as</p>
$$
Y(i,j)=(X * W)(i,j) = \sum_m\sum_n X(i-m,j-n)W(m,n).
$$

<p>Normally the latter is more straightforward to implement in a machine
larning library since there is less variation in the range of values
of \( m \) and \( n \).

cross-correlation instead of convolution (although it is referred to as

\boldsymbol{W}=\begin{bmatrix}w_{00} & w_{01} \\
	              w_{10} & w_{11}\end{bmatrix}.
$$

<p>We introduce now the hyperparameter \( S \) <b>stride</b>. Stride represents how the filter \( W \) moves the convolution process on the matrix \( X \).
We strongly recommend the repository on <a href="https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic" target="_blank">Arithmetic of deep learning by Dumoulin and Visin</a> 
</p>

<p>Here we set the stride equal to \( S=1 \), which means that, starting with the element \( x_{00} \), the filter will act on \( 2\times 2 \) submatrices each time, starting with the upper corner and moving according to the stride value column by column. </p>

<p>Here we perform the operation</p>
$$
Y_(i,j)=(X * W)(i,j) = \sum_m\sum_n X(i-m,j-n)W(m,n),
$$

<p>and obtain</p>
$$
\boldsymbol{Y}=\begin{bmatrix}x_{00}w_{00}+x_{01}w_{01}+x_{10}w_{10}+x_{11}w_{11} & x_{01}w_{00}+x_{02}w_{01}+x_{11}w_{10}+x_{12}w_{11}  \\

$$

<p>We can rewrite this operation in terms of a matrix-vector multiplication by defining a new vector where we flatten out the inputs as a vector \( \boldsymbol{X}' \) of length \( 9 \) and
a matrix \( \boldsymbol{W}' \) with dimension \( 4\times 9 \) as

$$
\boldsymbol{X}'=\begin{bmatrix}x_{00} \\ x_{01} \\ x_{02} \\ x_{10} \\ x_{11} \\ x_{12} \\ x_{20} \\ x_{21} \\ x_{22} \end{bmatrix},

$$
\boldsymbol{W}'=\begin{bmatrix} w_{00} & w_{01} & 0 & w_{10} & w_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
                        0  & w_{00} & w_{01} & 0 & w_{10} & w_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

$$

<p>We see easily that performing the matrix-vector multiplication \( \boldsymbol{W}'\boldsymbol{X}' \) is the same as the above convolution with stride \( S=1 \), that is</p>

$$
Y=(\boldsymbol{W}*\boldsymbol{X}),
$$

<p>is now given by \( \boldsymbol{W}'\boldsymbol{X}' \) which is a vector of length \( 4 \) instead of the originally resulting  \( 2\times 2 \) output matrix.</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-cnn-setups">Examples of CNN setups </h2>

<p>Let us assume we have an input volume \( V \) given by an image of dimensionality
\( 32\times 32 \times 3 \), that is three color channels and \( 32\times 32 \) pixels.
</p>

<p>We apply a filter of dimension \( 5\times 5 \) ten times with stride \( S=1 \) and padding \( P=0 \).</p>

<p>The output volume is given by \( (32-5)/1+1=28 \), resulting in ten images
of dimensionality \( 28\times 28\times 3 \).
</p>

<p>The total number of parameters to train for each filter is then
\( 5\times 5\times 3+1 \), where the last parameter is the bias. This
gives us \( 76 \) parameters for each filter, leading to a total of \( 760 \)
parameters for the ten filters.
</p>

<p>How many parameters will a filter of dimensionality \( 3\times 3 \)
(adding color channels) result in if we produce \( 32 \) new images? Use \( S=1 \) and \( P=0 \).
</p>

<p>Note that strides constitute a form of <b>subsampling</b>. As an alternative to
being interpreted as a measure of how much the kernel/filter is translated, strides
can also be viewed as how much of the output is retained. For instance, moving
the kernel by hops of two is equivalent to moving the kernel by hops of one but
retaining only odd output elements.

<h2 id="pooling">Pooling </h2>

<p>In addition to discrete convolutions themselves, <b>pooling</b> operations
make up another important building block in CNNs. Pooling operations reduce
the size of feature maps by using some function to summarize subregions, such
as taking the average or the maximum value.
</p>

<p>Pooling works by sliding a window across the input and feeding the content of
the window to a <b>pooling function</b>. In some sense, pooling works very much
like a discrete convolution, but replaces the linear combination described by
the kernel with some other function.
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="pooling-arithmetic">Pooling arithmetic </h2>

<p>In a neural network, pooling layers provide invariance to small translations of
the input. The most common kind of pooling is <b>max pooling</b>, which
consists in splitting the input in (usually non-overlapping) patches and
outputting the maximum value of each patch. Other kinds of pooling exist, e.g.,
mean or average pooling, which all share the same idea of aggregating the input
locally by applying a non-linearity to the content of some patches.

<h2 id="building-convolutional-neural-networks-using-tensorflow-and-keras">Building convolutional neural networks using Tensorflow and Keras </h2>

<p>As discussed above, CNNs are neural networks built from the assumption that the inputs
to the network are 2D images. This is important because the number of features or pixels in images
grows very fast with the image size, and an enormous number of weights and biases are needed in order to build an accurate network.  
</p>

<p>As before, we still have our input, a hidden layer and an output. What's novel about convolutional networks
are the <b>convolutional</b> and <b>pooling</b> layers stacked in pairs between the input and the hidden layer.
In addition, the data is no longer represented as a 2D feature matrix, instead each input is a number of 2D
matrices, typically 1 for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue). 
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="setting-it-up">Setting it up </h2>

<p>It means that to represent the entire
dataset of images, we require a 4D matrix or <b>tensor</b>. This tensor has the dimensions:  
</p>
$$  
(n_{inputs},\, n_{pixels, width},\, n_{pixels, height},\, depth) .
$$


<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="the-mnist-dataset-again">The MNIST dataset again </h2>

<p>The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images with a pixel size of
\( 28\times 28 \), meaning we require \( 28 \times 28 = 724 \) weights to each
neuron in the first hidden layer.
</p>

<p>If we were to analyze images of size \( 128\times 128 \) we would require
\( 128 \times 128 = 16384 \) weights to each neuron. Even worse if we were
dealing with color images, as most images are, we have an image matrix
of size \( 128\times 128 \) for each color dimension (Red, Green, Blue),
meaning 3 times the number of weights \( = 49152 \) are required for every
single neuron in the first hidden layer.
</p>


<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="strong-correlations">Strong correlations </h2>

<p>Images typically have strong local correlations, meaning that a small
part of the image varies little from its neighboring regions. If for
example we have an image of a blue car, we can roughly assume that a
small blue part of the image is surrounded by other blue regions.
</p>

<p>Therefore, instead of connecting every single pixel to a neuron in the
first hidden layer, as we have previously done with deep neural
networks, we can instead connect each neuron to a small part of the
image (in all 3 RGB depth dimensions).  The size of each small area is
fixed, and known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_field" target="_blank">receptive</a>.
</p>


<!-- !split  -->
<h2 id="layers-of-a-cnn">Layers of a CNN </h2>

<p>The layers of a convolutional neural network arrange neurons in 3D: width, height and depth.  
The input image is typically a square matrix of depth 3. 
</p>

<p>A <b>convolution</b> is performed on the image which outputs
a 3D volume of neurons. The weights to the input are arranged in a number of 2D matrices, known as <b>filters</b>.
</p>

<p>Each filter slides along the input image, taking the dot product
between each small part of the image and the filter, in all depth
dimensions. This is then passed through a non-linear function,
typically the <b>Rectified Linear (ReLu)</b> function, which serves as the
activation of the neurons in the first convolutional layer. This is
further passed through a <b>pooling layer</b>, which reduces the size of the
convolutional layer, e.g. by taking the maximum or average across some
small regions, and this serves as input to the next convolutional
layer.
</p>

<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="systematic-reduction">Systematic reduction </h2>

<p>By systematically reducing the size of the input volume, through
convolution and pooling, the network should create representations of
small parts of the input, and then from them assemble representations
of larger areas.  The final pooling layer is flattened to serve as
input to a hidden layer, such that each neuron in the final pooling
layer is connected to every single neuron in the hidden layer. This
then serves as input to the output layer, e.g. a softmax output for
classification.

<h2 id="set-up-the-model">Set up  the model </h2>

<p>The 6 lines of code below define the convolutional base using a common pattern: a stack of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers.</p>

<p>As input, a CNN takes tensors of shape (image_height, image_width, color_channels), ignoring the batch size. If you are new to these dimensions, color_channels refers to (R,G,B). In this example, you will configure our CNN to process inputs of shape (32, 32, 3), which is the format of CIFAR images. You can do this by passing the argument input_shape to our first layer.</p>

<p>You can see that the output of every Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layer is a 3D tensor of shape (height, width, channels). The width and height dimensions tend to shrink as you go deeper in the network. The number of output channels for each Conv2D layer is controlled by the first argument (e.g., 32 or 64). Typically, as the width and height shrink, you can afford (computationally) to add more output channels in each Conv2D layer.</p>

<h2 id="add-dense-layers-on-top">Add Dense layers on top </h2>

<p>To complete our model, you will feed the last output tensor from the
convolutional base (of shape (4, 4, 64)) into one or more Dense layers
to perform classification. Dense layers take vectors as input (which
are 1D), while the current output is a 3D tensor. First, you will
flatten (or unroll) the 3D output to 1D, then add one or more Dense
layers on top. CIFAR has 10 output classes, so you use a final Dense
layer with 10 outputs and a softmax activation.
